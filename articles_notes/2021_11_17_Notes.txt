Issue 1: MA keeps track of significant bill changes by changing the bill number. VA legislature does not have this. Worth looking into?

Does VA legislature allow written testimony?



TODO for me:
Create Sankey that has dead bills pointed at a separate node for dead bills
Create Sankey that has 1 observation going to return paths
