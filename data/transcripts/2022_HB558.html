                We urge the Committee to OPPOSE HB558 (O&#39;Quinn -R) – related to Biogas.

While there is no question that methane released by feedstock is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, the solution proposed in this bill is NOT the right solution – or at very minimum more research and more guarantees in the bill would be needed to ensure that this would in fact result in methane reduction.   As it stands, the bill provides NO ASSURANCE that it will result in methane reduction and its implementation would be extremely detrimental both to the environment/climate and to Virginia taxpayers.    This bill is STRONGLY opposed by all the major environmental organizations including:
 
Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, NRDC, Nature Conservancy, Va League of Conservation Voters, Virginia Conservation Network

             Reasons to Oppose and Explanations: 
1. The bills allow concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) as locations where methane could be captured and inserted into pipelines as gas. This would allow gas companies to propose connector pipelines to reach site(s) closest to their existing lines. Since the CAFO could profit from the purchase of the gas, the bill incentivizes the production of methane at these sites and further incentivises CAFOs already horrendous management practices. There exists a profit motive, and both the gas company and the CAFO facility want nothing more. The waste lagoons associated with CAFOs are doing significant damage; both to the environment through leaching of the unlined ponds and to the communities in which they are located, which are almost always environmental justice communities. Environmental justice communities would be subjected to the continued purposeful development of methane for the purpose of feeding a gas industry pipeline(s). 

2. The bills contain no required environmental benefit associated with the allowance of new gas infrastructure. The bill would allow the gas industry to propose connector lines to CAFOs, wastewater treatment sites, and landfills, construct them, and not even have to guarantee that methane emissions at the site will be reduced or that the overall project will reduce methane. Gas companies get to build &amp; prove nothing. 

3. The bills contain little to no consumer protections for the ratepayer of the gas companies. The gas industry is highjacking “emissions reductions” as the sole justification for tens of millions in increased ratepayer costs but refusing to prove in any way that the emissions went down due to the investment. It&#39;s greenwashing at its finest. The ratepayer is on the hook for the construction and maintenance, and they don’t even get cleaner air.

                Methane is a fatal greenhouse gas emitted by human activities like raising livestock.  Bill HB558 will allow concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to act as locations where methane could be captured and inserted into pipelines as gas.  CAFO facilities are nortrious to producing waste lagoons that harm the environment through leaching of the unlined ponds and to the communities in which they are located.  HB558 will guarantee gas industries to propose connector lines to CAFOs, wastewater treatment sites, and landfills. CAFOs will profit on such projects that would most likely result in unnecessary productions of methane gas. By allowing this bill to pass,  you will be undermining not only the environment of Virginia, but also consumer protections for the ratepayer of the gas companies as well by increasing the production of waste energy.  This bill will cause dire consequences to the Commonwealth of Virginia and that is why CCAN Action Fund opposes VA HB558.
