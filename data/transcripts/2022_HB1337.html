                I’m Joan Lowy, director of Quiet Clean NOVA.
Despite their relatively small size, gas-powered leaf blowers emit a tremendous amount of noise and pollution. HB1337 would enable local governments to regulate these machines. The bill is permissive – local governments aren’t required to take any action if they choose not to. If leaf blower noise and pollution isn’t an issue in your community, no problem. But public officials in communities where residents are complaining that gas-powered leaf blowers are disturbing their peace and fouling their air would be able to curb their use under HB1337. Please let the elected officials who are closest to the people decide what solution best fits their community.
Gas-powered leaf blowers are typically used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass clipping. They generate an especially deep, oscillating noise. Research has shown that the noise from gas-powered leaf blowers travels farther and penetrates windows and walls more easily than other engine noise. It&#39;s like second-hand smoke – you can’t escape it. The seriousness of this problem is increasing as more people work and study at home.
Most gas-powered leaf blowers have crude 2-stroke engines that use a mix of gas and oil. These are the same types of engines typically used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in many Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this obsolete technology, but its use continues unchecked in the U.S. landscape industry.
About a third of that fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. This includes known carcinogens such as benzene, butadiene, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says a popular model gas-powered leaf blower emits as much smog-forming pollutants in ONE HOUR as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. A test by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke engine backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons and 23 times more carbon monoxide than a 6,200-pound Ford 150 Raptor pickup truck. 
We’re asking you to give us some relief. Please pass HB1337.
Thank you for your consideration.

                Please support HB1337 to empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers.   Lawn crews arrive at neighbors&#39; yards at the crack of dawn and spend hours standing just around and blowing every single leave they can find, well beyond what is necessary to keep excess leaves from killing the grass.   They blow the leaves off of the driveway and sidewalks into the streets, and then they turn around and blow the leaves off of the street.
And it is not just one neighbor.  As soon as one crew finishes, another crew starts up at another house, or multiple crews overlap at different neighbors, droning on and on and on in stereo.  All. day.  long.  All autumn long.  It ruins everybody else&#39;s right to quiet enjoyment of their property.  One really should be able to open the house&#39;s windows and enjoy nature when the summer temperatures finally break.  
And it is not just in autumn.   It&#39;s more leave-blowing in the winter.  It&#39;s blowers for leaf-cleanup in the spring.  It&#39;s blowing grass clippings in the summer.  
The homeowners may not even be aware of how long their lawn crews are there aggravating the neighbors because the homeowners commonly are away at work and don&#39;t have to deal with it themselves.  But it is certainly noticed by the neighbors who work from home.

                I fully support HB1337. As a home owner and tax payer, I&#39;m appalled by how prevalent these old fashioned nuisances have become year-round in VA. Gas powered leaf blowers are destructive to community air quality and cause horrific noise pollution. It&#39;s an antiquated technology that can easily be replaced by cleaner alternatives. The sooner they are banned the better, and the faster that cleaner alternatives will be embraced. Help Virginia be cleaner, less noisy, and smell less like gasoline year round! Offer incentives to move to cleaner alternatives, and we can put old fashioned fossil fuel based tech behind us.

                I strongly support Kaye Kory&#39;s Bill HB1337.  Polluting gas powered leaf blowers are a nuisance and are bad for the environment and the health of users.  Electric powered motors are much quieter and are a good alternative.  Noise knows no bounds and using gas powered motors disturbs the peace for the entire community.

                Please save all of Virginias history, by leaving our monuments intact and historic memorabilia on display.  The Commonwealths history should not offend anyone who takes the time to understand it and respect the changes that occurred.  For instance Virginias State park history,  the Commonwealth’s Roadways or the quaint country town with the history of its namesake and deep rooted genealogy of the people who lived there. 
The Monuments are no different, they speak of times gone by, appreciated by some, disliked by others.  Maybe they are a symbol that change is needed and to remind us to do so, whatever the cause, our history brought us to this day in time. We need to respect each other’s heritage and appreciate how each native Virginian helped to shape all of us.
Respectfully, Alan Crawford

                I would like to register my support of HB 1337 for the peace and health of the citizens of Fairfax County. I live in Lake Barcroft, a community with an enormous number of trees. The proliferation of noisy and polluting gas-powered leaf blowers seriously impinges on my and my neighbors enjoyment of our community, and impacts our health and welfare. Gas blowers are unregulated and spew air pollutants in incredibly higher quantities that automobiles. When landscape companies are working near our home, with two or three blowers going at the same time, we can smell the exhaust fumes on our property and the noise is deafening. Please give localities the power to regulate this equipment. There are battery-powered alternatives (I have one!) that are just as effective as the gas-powered blowers, and the trend nationwide in communities around the country is to get rid of these blowers and go green with battery-powered equipment. New landscaping companies are being established that solely use battery-operated and solar-charged landscaping equipment.  Fairfax County itself will phase out the use of gas-powered leaf blowers in county operations. Please pass this bill.

                Pass HB1337 (Kory)
Gas-powered leaf blowers (GLBs) are disturbing the peace and fouling the air of Virginia communities. They are often used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass-clippings. Cities and counties are severely limited in their ability to curb the use of GLBs. HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines. With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem takes on greater urgency.
Background
Most GLBs have crude 2-stroke engines that emit an oscillating noise research shows travels farther and is more likely to penetrate walls and windows than other types of engine noise. US health agencies consider 85 decibels to be the threshold at which hearing damage takes place. GLBs often measure over 100 decibels at the ear of the operator, which means people using them for just a few hours, such as lawn care workers, are likely to experience hearing loss. Even when measured from farther away, GLBs often exceed 70 decibels. The World Health Organization says outdoor noise over 55 decibels is disturbing to people.
For their size, GLBs have an outsized impact on the environment. Their engines are similar to those used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in some Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this technology, but its use persists unchecked in the US lawn care industry. About a third of GLBs’ fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. These emissions include such known carcinogens as benzene, butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says using a popular model GLB for ONE HOUR emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. Tests by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons than a Ford 150 pickup truck.
There are alternatives, including battery-powered leaf blowers. A growing number of landscape companies are using all-battery equipment – mowers, blowers, edgers, trimmers, etc. Often, they recharge batteries using mobile solar panels on the roofs of their trucks. They have made this switch because it’s good business. Battery equipment doesn’t have the same overhead as gas-powered machines. You don’t have to buy fuel or filters, and there’s less maintenance and fewer repairs. Companies say the return on investment over time is greater with battery equipment. Please empower local governments to nudge GLB users into modernizing their equipment for the health and tranquility of their communities.

                I strongly support HB1337, the bill giving local jurisdictions claim to regulate the use of gas powered leaf blowers.  The high decibel production of these tools causes hearing loss in the users and anyone in the immediate and relatively distant vicinity.  The exhaust emitted causes much air pollution.  The damage to wildlife--birds, the reproductive cycle of insects which feed birds, and humans is high.  Electric and battery powered blowers are quieter and pollute less.  Please, for the sake of our environment, our ecosystem, wild animals and humans, pass this bill.  Respectfully submitted.  Thank you for your time.

                 Please support HB 1337 to enable Virginia local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. Gas-powered leaf blowers emit high decibel levels of noise pollution which is incessant for months, every single day!  Gas blowers also emit massive amounts of carbon pollution. They cashed serious harm to lung health and heart health, not to mention mental health, with their constant awful noise.  They disturb the tranquility of the neighborhood, endanger the hearing and health of landscape workers forced to use them.  That’s a serious equity issue.  Noise levels exceed 100 decibels, producing a low-frequency roar that penetrates our entire neighborhood on a daily basis for months.  Pollutants include smog-forming nitrous oxides, greenhouse gas emissions, and carcinogenic hydrocarbons.  Additionally, gas blowers, with their blowing power,  blow off critical insect eggs from the leaves, the chrysalis of lunar moths and other pollinators, as well as the eggs of fireflies.  How much more must we disturb the eco balance of nature?  More than 100 communities across the United States now restrict or ban gas-powered leaf blowers, including Washington, DC.  I would like to see gas powered blowers completely eliminated, particularly because of their harm to the climate and wildlife.  Electric and battery operated blowers are very effective now and are far quieter and do not pollute as  much.  Please allow local governments to address the issue as needed, not only to restore peace and quiet but also reduce pollution.

                I strongly support HB1337 to give local jurisdictions the authority to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. The noise created by leaf blowers is ear shattering at its worst. The fumes are known to be extremely dangerous to our health as are the now proven ill effects of the noise. Further they are seemingly ever present.  They are as antiquated as buggy whips because new technology, including solar panel-powered machines, has provided workable and sustainable alternatives.  Find a way to help the “buggy-whip” companies and their employees transition to state-of-the-art tools and solve both problems... environmental preservation and employment generation.

                Please support (SB537 or HB1346). Because of the unregulated use of noisy, carcinogen-spewing gas-powered leaf blowers throughout our neighborhood and surrounding areas,  sitting outside is disrupted by the penetrating noise and fumes of gas-powered machines. Please empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers should they choose to do so. Your support of our quality of life is desperately needed.

                I strongly support this bill and urge lawmakers to pass it. The amount of emissions, air pollution and noise pollution produced by these machines is terrible, and most are produced by a relatively few companies and ppl while everyone else suffers. There is such a high externality cost produced. And there are much cleaner and quieter alternatives! We should phase out all Gas powered lawn tools and incentivize electric or manual counterparts.

                I am writing in support of HB1337 that would authorize localities to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. It gives authority (but no requirement to act) to the unit of government closest to the people, and is not burdensome because of its phased-in approach. While I personally wouldn&#39;t oppose banning them altogether, this legislation is a reasonable approach to reducing toxic emissions, increasing workplace safety, and reducing noise pollution in our neighborhoods. Let&#39;s enable Virginia communities to join hundreds of other communities around the country to take this important step.

                Although this may seem to be a relatively small issue, small changes can have larger impacts. Allowing local governments to regulate gas leaf blowers could result in a larger shift towards electric leaf blowers that ends up reducing toxic emissions in a meaningful way. Supporting HB 1337 is an easy way to make a positive change for our communities.

                I&#39;m writing to ask that you support HB1337 to empower local governments to regulate the use of gas-powered leaf blowers.  Gas-powered leaf blowers (GLBs) are disturbing the peace and fouling the air of Virginia communities.  These machines are used almost year-round, often just to blow around grass clippings.  HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines.  With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem has become more acute.

GLB engines emit an oscillating noise that is louder, travels farther, and penetrates walls more easily than noise emitted by other types of engines.  Moreover, their inefficient 2-stroke engines generate staggering amounts of pollution.  About one-third of their fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air.  Tests by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke backpack leaf blower engine emitted 300 TIMES more hydrocarbons than a Ford 150 pickup truck.  In addition, GLB emissions include known carcinogens such as benzene, butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. 

More than 150 communities around the country have already acted to curb the use of these noisy, filthy machines. There are several alternatives to GLBs, including battery-powered leaf blowers, which have been found to be just as effective and more economical over time.  

HB1337 will not require anything of local governments.  Rather, it will simply give them the ability to take some action regarding leaf blowers if they choose to do so.  Please give local public officials in Virginia the right to determine solutions for their communities where gas-powered leaf blowers are disturbing the peace and polluting the air.

                Please support HB # 1337 allowing localities to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers.  They produce harmful pollution, both air pollution and noise pollution.  They are harmful to people who use them and people who are nearby when they are being used.  They cause hearing loss and lung damage, to name a few of the more serious health consequences. They disturb and kill plant life and wildlife.   They are unnecessary.  The environment benefits when leaves and grass clippings are left where they are to decompose and nourish plant and animal life.  Brooms and rakes are better alternatives to leaf blowers.

                I wish localities were free to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. They are polluting and noisy, and lots of people don&#39;t like that. Communities in Virginia should be able to regulate things like this.

                As a Virginia resident concerned about health and the environment, not to mention our neighborhood noise levels, I’m writing to ask that you support HB1337 to empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. 

These machines are used for most of the year just to blow grass clippings around, while their two-stroke engines make a howling, oscillating noise that is louder,  travels farther and penetrates walls more easily than noise from other types of equipment. The engines also produce staggering levels of pollution. About a third of their fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. The California Air Resources Board says that using a popular model gas-powered leaf blower for ONE HOUR emits as much pollution as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles.
 
There are alternatives, including battery-powered leaf blowers. More than 150 communities around the country have already acted to curb these noisy, polluting machines. This bill is permissive. If you don’t feel gas-powered leaf blowers are a problem in your community, your local government is under no obligation to act. But please give public officials in Virginia communities where gas-powered leaf blowers are disturbing the peace and fouling the air the ability to craft their own solution.
 
Sincerely,
Mike Christensen
Vienna

                I strongly support HB1337, empowering local jurisdictions to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers.  The noise produced by these machines is obnoxious and dangerous for users and everyone in the neighborhood.  Many jurisdictions around the U.S. are regulating or banning gas-powered leaf blowers.  Fortunately alternatives are readily available in battery-powered electric equipment for homeowners and commercial landscapers.  This comment is in support of the grass-roots group Quiet Clean NOVA, which is educating neighbors and users about the problem and solutions.

                I support this bill as a first step toward a quieter approach to landscaping and lawn care. We are a nation of inventors, and we can invent and use tools that are quieter and less harmful to humans and animals. Jurisdictions should have the ability to decide how to manage their landscapes to promote a healthy environment for all.

                This is a great initiative. It offers local communities a way to move forward in partnership with lawn care companies to limit and reduce the use of gas leaf blowers while ensuring that companies have time to adapt and sustain employment in this sector.  In general , gas blowers are terribly damaging to habitats and quite disruptive to study and work for the millions of Virginians at home during the working day. Their fumes are a menace - I have to run or walk to the opposite side of the street when I am near them, but workers are with them all day. 

I believe strongly that local communities best represent their citizens, not the distant state government in Richmond. Republicans and Democrats should embrace the rights of communities to set stricter limits on the use of gas leaf blowers by commercial companies.  It is true that electric blowers have limitations, which is why a period of regulation and adaptation is best for companies and homeowners to adapt, but we do need to begin this change.  This bill represents a great win for the health of Virginians and for the liveability of our communities.

                Dear Legislators, the level of noise in my community caused by leaf-blowing, snow-blowing, and other landscape activities powered by gas equipment is deafening and constant. I have had to resort to wearing noise-blocking ear muffs of the kind used at airports by runway personnel just to be able to have peace inside my own home.   The many months of the year when I am no longer able to enjoy my outdoor space is increasing because of the incessant noise.  None of this is necessary when there are environmentally healthier and efficient options.  Please support HB 1337 for the peace and health of the citizens of the Commonwealth.  Thank you

                I am writing to ask you to support Kaye Kory’s House Bill 1337 Gas-powered leaf blowers; local regulation, civil penalty.  When we bought a house in a forested lake community, we thought that we would be spending our retirement years in a nature-lovers’ paradise with a peaceful quality of life.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Because of the unregulated use of noisy, carcinogen-spewing gas-powered leaf blowers throughout our neighborhood and surrounding areas, we might as well be living in a construction zone seven days a week from dawn until dusk. There is never a time when we can sit outside with friends or take a dip in the lake without the infernal penetrating noise and fumes of these antiquated, unregulated machines. The stress is overwhelming for adults and children alike, and the  medical literature documents the consequences on our health and hearing.  Please empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers should they choose to do so.  Your support of our quality of life is desperately needed.

                One of the good things about this time of year is that there is no noise and air pollution being generated by gasoline leaf blowers in our neighborhood.  It won’t be long, however, when the landscape companies return to our street with these obnoxious machines.  For most of the year, it is almost a daily occurrence, sometimes  even on weekends.  The noise  even can begin  before and after normal work hours. And, unless you pass HB 1337, our local authorities continue to be almost powerless to mitigate the problem .
Aside from the fact that these devices are annoying, research has shown they are highly polluting, as much as 20 times the pollution caused by a mid-sized gasoline-powered passenger car. Plus, there are alternatives, such as battery operated leaf blowers.
This bill deftly avoids the sledge-hammer approach of a state-wide regulation, but allows local jurisdictions—if they so choose—to make specific requirements that account for their situation.  I urge you to report this bill to the House of Delegates for a vote.
Thank you,
Robin Kent

                Dear Counties, Cities and Towns Committee,
 
Being residents of Dublin, Ireland, we can&#39;t vote in Virginia elections, but as  impacts us, we decided to write to you.  Please support HB1337 to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. 

We haven&#39;t visited our two daughters, one in Virginia, one in Maryland, for a decade because of infernal noise from their neighbors&#39; lawn mowers, and when this is over, just when we think we&#39;ll get some peace and quiet, out come the blowers, blowing largely nothing. We were thinking of coming in the winter, but the weather is cold, and gas-powered blowers are still used. These machines are used year round, and the noise travels easily through walls of homes. At no time of the year is there respite from the noise.

Being in our 80s, we depend on a good two-hour nap every afternoon - as do many old people. Or else we can&#39;t make it through to the evening. As the households of our daughters are busy and chaotic, weather permitting, we prefer to set up our chairs under a shady tree and nap there. Our being outside also gives the families space. We don&#39;t want to be under their feet all day. We also spend the afternoon reading out on the deck - again to give the families space - but we have to come inside when lawn crews arrive. Long visits can be stressful to hosts!

We enjoy family meals on the deck - but again these are often disrupted by landscaper crews, and we have to grab plates, glasses, silverware, and dishes to scurry inside to shelter from the noise - 15 to 20 minutes per yard for summer mow &#39;n&#39; blows, and up to an hour in leaf season. Such obtrusive interruptions is no way to enjoy family life. 

In densely populated areas, why are 100 dB-level engines, permitted on a routine basis, when quiet alternatives exist? Battery lawn mowers are no noisier than dishwashers. Battery blowers are less noisy and are emission-free.  Best of all are rakes. Is the lower cost of gas mowers and blowers, given the noise and dirty emissions, really worth the disruption to the quality of life?

You have beautiful tall trees in Virginia - but the price for having them, it seems, is the frantic and noisy removal of all their fallen leaves.

When I bring up this issue to others, I&#39;ve been told it would harm the livelihoods of thousands of workers. Has this been the case in cities with gas blower bans or restrictions? If so, do we permit loud disruptive noise because this loud disruptive noise helps employ people? Surely a business is there to serve the needs of society, not vice versa.

Republicans and Democrats, protecting the quality of life should be a common sense, non-partisan issue. 
Any measure that can regulate gas mowers or gas blowers is a win for peace and quiet in Virginia neighborhoods.
Vote yes for HB1337!

Sincerely,
Roger and Lal Garland

Regulating gas leaf blowers should be a totally bi-partisan issue. Every day of the year, the noise and pollution from these filthy 2-stroke engines fills our streets and homes, degrading the quality of life in communities all over the U.S.
And it is NOT A MATTER OF FREE CHOICE as to how one moves one&#39;s leaves. Gas leaf blowers don&#39;t just drive leaves to the curb, they also drive people raking back into their homes. If neighbor A is blowing his leaves, neighbor B won&#39;t rake his at the same time. Likewise, those gardening or just sitting outside enjoying their yards are driven indoors. Friends or family sharing a meal on their deck have to get up and continue their meal elsewhere. 
Most of us spend at least 30 years working to pay for our homes and we are entitled to the rightful use and enjoyment of our own properties. We rely on our homes for peace and quiet. They are our sanctuaries from an often harsh and unfair world. Hence, no one should have to tolerate loud noise invading their homes and yards without a compelling reason.
Loud noise in neighborhoods should be limited to the providers of emergency services and the occasional setting off of fireworks.
Using gas leaf blowers in residential areas is not just inconsiderate, it is anti-social and should be strongly discouraged. Localities must have the authority to curb the plague of noise and toxic fumes these machines inflict upon them on a daily basis. Let&#39;s put peace before profits! 
Please support HB1337.

                Leaf blowers in residential neighborhoods severely disrupt taxpayers&#39; quality of life from March through December - 10 full months of the year. They disrupt sleep. They disrupt work. They disrupt conversations, phone calls, and Zoom meetings.  They persist daily, from dawn &#39;til dark. They cause anxiety and other health issues, especially ill health effects resulting from disrupted sleep. The health-injuring noise is utterly inescapable, as it penetrates walls and permeates every inch of indoor space.  Toxic fumes from inconsiderate neighbors&#39; daily use also penetrate indoor space, causing further health injury.  Despite the fact that these public NUISANCES wildly exceed noise code decibel limits, local authorities claim that noise ordinances are &quot;unenforceable,&quot; and so they abdicate responsibility for protecting taxpayers from that persistent nuisance. These same local bureaucrats claim that &quot;if only the State would grant us power to regulate, we could address the problem.&quot; Well, State, here is your chance: DO SOMETHING! Pass H.R.1337. Thank you.

                Please support HB 1337 tallow for local regulation of gas-powered leaf blowers. They prepresent a serious threat to the health and safety of residents and the machine operators.
Localities should have the right to regulate use according to their specific conditions and needs.

                Please make this as strong as possible so communities can  have control over the noise and pollution in their very back yards. It is hugely important for access to a safe , happy and healthy life.  So many other cities are cutting the way for this, and DC has banned them along with Miami Beach! And California!Thank you

                I support a total ban on gas powered leaf blowers.   HB 1337  is inadequate because it does not allow communities the option of banning and prohibiting these obnoxious and very loud polluting machines.

                Gas-powered leaf blowers (GLBs) are disturbing the peace and fouling the air of Virginia communities. They are often used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass-clippings. Cities and counties are severely limited in their ability to curb the use of GLBs. HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines. With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem takes on greater urgency.

Background
Most GLBs have crude 2-stroke engines that emit an oscillating noise research shows travels farther and is more likely to penetrate walls and windows than other types of engine noise. US health agencies consider 85 decibels to be the threshold at which hearing damage takes place. GLBs often measure over 100 decibels at the ear of the operator, which means people using them for just a few hours, such as lawn care workers, are likely to experience hearing loss. Even when measured from farther away, GLBs often exceed 70 decibels. The World Health Organization says outdoor noise over 55 decibels is disturbing to people.

For their size, GLBs have an outsized impact on the environment. Their engines are similar to those used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in some Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this technology, but its use persists unchecked in the US lawn care industry. About a third of GLBs’ fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. These emissions include such known carcinogens as benzene, butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says using a popular model GLB for ONE HOUR emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. Tests by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons than a Ford 150 pickup truck.

There are alternatives, including battery-powered leaf blowers. A growing number of landscape companies are using all-battery equipment – mowers, blowers, edgers, trimmers, etc. Often, they recharge batteries using mobile solar panels on the roofs of their trucks. They have made this switch because it’s good business. Battery equipment doesn’t have the same overhead as gas-powered machines. You don’t have to buy fuel or filters, and there’s less maintenance and fewer repairs. Companies say the return on investment over time is greater with battery equipment. Please empower local governments to nudge GLB users into modernizing their equipment for the health and tranquility of their communities.
