                On behalf of Appalachian Voices, our organization opposes this bill. While the clean-up of GOB is crucially important to improving the environment in Southwest Virginia, this tax credit is unnecessary. Dominion Energy is already burning coal refuse at the VCHEC without tax incentives; so far more than 4 million tons of gob have been burned at VCHEC. The plant was designed for this purpose, and is doing so as designed. While there is an enormous amount of GOB left to be cleaned up in SWVA, the Federal government just recently enacted the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes an $11.3 billion investment into cleaning up abandoned coal features. Virginia will receive 10 times as much funding for abandoned coal mine land clean-up funding for the next 15 years, which can go toward cleaning up the highest-priority GOB sites. Creating a tax credit for burning GOB puts an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. 
Finally, SB 120 (Hackworth) and HB 657 (Wampler) propose to inventory and study how to best clean up GOB piles in Southwest Virginia. The General Assembly should wait for the results of this study before creating tax credits to incentivize burning GOB in power plants. 

Please oppose this bill.

                My name is Rebecca Shelton and I am submitting comments on behalf of Appalachian Citizens&#39; Law Center, a public interest law firm and non-profit advocacy organization that works in and represents clients from Eastern Kentucky and Southwest Virginia. We oppose this bill. 

This bill creates a tax credit to incentivize the burning of coal refuse, or gob. We see this as unnecessary for two primary reasons. First, Dominion Energy, without this credit, is already burning coal refuse at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center in Wise County, Virginia. The plant was designed for this purpose and creating a credit is unnecessary.

Second, the federal government recently enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill which adds $11.3 billion dollars to the federal abandoned coal mine grant program. Over the next fifteen years, Virginia will receive nearly 10 times as much federal funding for the clean up of gob and other abandoned coal features compared to recent years. Given this infusion of federal funds, creating a state tax incentive to clean up gob is unwarranted at this time. 

In addition to being unnecessary, the bill incentivizes the use of gob but it does not require that the gob be from Virginia in order to be eligible for the tax credit. As the tax credit cap is greater than the amount of funding that has been identified as needed for gob cleanup in Virginia (according to Virginia&#39; s coal mine inventory), the tax credit would likely be used to truck waste coal into Southwest Virginia; Virginia taxpayers would be subsidizing the cleanup of coal-mining waste.

We ask you to vote against HB656. Though gob cleanup is critical for Southwest Virginia, we&#39;ve seen no evidence to support the mechanism through which that bill proposes to achieve that - incentivizing an activity that is already occurring - and believe that the federal AML funds, instead, will help address this issue. 

Thank you for allowing me to provide testimony.

                A 2011 Harvard report found that the life cycle effects of coal and the waste stream generated are costing the U.S. public a third to over one-half of a trillion dollars annually. The HB 656 bill uses taxpayer money to incentivize the burning of coal refuse at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center (VCHEC). The excessive use of burning coal refuse would put communities along the transportation path at risk of environmental disasters and become more exposed to harmful emissions. Also, HB 656 creates a nonrefundable income tax credit for Dominion Energy for 2023-2027 equal to $4/ton of qualified coal refuse used to generate electricity at VCHEC.   This bill will not only harm Virginia environmentally, but economically as well. And it is for these reasons, CCAN Action Fund opposes this bill HB656.

                SUMMARY: Kathy Selvage of Wise, VA addresses the VA Assembly 
Subcommittee on Finance regarding HB 656: 
Dominion’s power plant in Wise County, VA was a boondoggle when 
proposed and it continues to be. 
Life extension for the plant last year was granted. Currently, the SB 120 is 
attempting to rename Garbage of Bituminous (GOB) as a renewable 
energy. This is an alternative truth. 
The economic viability of the plant and industry are enhanced by subsidies 
(HB 656) through tax reductions that robs the tax coffers, and further 
increases their economic viability by tossing the health and environmental 
costs onto the community and its inhabitants. 
The Commonwealth is proposing the same path as Pennsylvania as they 
have the most waste burning plants in the nation and try to include waste 
coal in their renewable portfolio. 
GOB is low energy producing (60%), forcing the use of more GOB, heavily 
laden with pollutants, and produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAH’s) during incineration. Pollutants are displaced from the air, never 
eradicated, and reappear in the toxic waste coal ash at about 85% of the 
entire amount of GOB used, thus creating mountains of toxic coal ash. 
There are safer ways to deal with the GOB piles of far southwest Virginia 
than this proposed scheme. 
Population loss in a single decade for Wise County reached 14.7% or 5,308 
as the young and college educated continue their flight in search of 
opportunity. Their future cannot be found in a GOB pile. 
This plan makes the continued destruction of Wise County legal and is 
absolutely the wrong trajectory.

                As you consider HB 656, keep in mind that Wise County is one of the most devastated counties in the world from mining activities.  They have no need to deal with garbage of bituminous coal (gob) from every corner and then with a higher load of mercury, arsenic, and coal ash on their lands and waters.  The drainage would be into  Clinch River -- the home of endanger mussels and fish.  There is no pressing need for all the gob piles to be burned. 

The burning of fossil fuels should have stopped yesterday. Coal power plants add greenhouses gases.  New record heat  confirmed within 6 miles of the Artic Circle of 100 degrees, and the record of 64.9 degrees in the Antarctic.  Siberia is going from ice to fires that burn year around.  Scientists are stunned at the rate of melt.  The huge ice shelf that is breaking off Antarctic will no longer block a massive, massive glacier.  The melting of that glacier will raise the sea levels in New Port News, Norfolk, and in the Chesapeake Bay.

The warming of the oceans affect ocean currents.  The Gulf Stream slows and may be on the cusp of major change so the rainfall amounts we need in the east for the forests and agriculture will be no longer.

Dominion Energy has its own resources and supplies many states with coal and nuclear power.  If you would incentivize their helping households and governments to go solar or other true clean energy moves , I would suggest the money move in that direction.  In fact, a higher rebate for households below say $125 k to get a higher rebate to go solar would serve the state.  

This bill just adds to calamity.  Like what happened in Hurley, Virginia with such heavy rainfall in a short period of time.  If that event had happened at night, they say it would have cost 100 lives.  You may not know but an engineer told me of a 35 inch rain event a few years ago.  Sections of Highway 58 --one lane lost in three curves--above Stuart were wiped out.  Our creek ran under and over the meadow. We have just lost orchard due to fire blight.

Now we have only two seasons--hot and cold- and the hot is gaining.  The gentle slow warming Appalachian Spring is long gone.  Animal and insect populations are crashing.  Read A Life on Our Planet by David Attenborough.

                As a Virginin, educated in Virginian Schools, we were taught the importance of the Constitution of the Commonwealth with regard to our Nation&#39;s Constitution. These documents are articles that are supposed to guide our self governance.

Article VIII, Section 10
Public dollars are not to go to schools NOT owned by the Commonwealth or a Municipality inside the Commonwealth&#39;s jurisdiction, except for when the Commonwealth has entered into an agreement with another jurisdiction.

The Commonwealth should also not engage in the endorsement of private education cartels, weakening the publicly available options. This would do a disservice to the people, because the people&#39;s representatives have less oversight with regard to private institutions, than they have through electing their local boards.
