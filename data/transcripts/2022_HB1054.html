                I strongly favor HB1054 and encourage you to pass it. It protects vulnerable Virginians from freezing or sweltering to death under extreme conditions, and makes it easier for them to pay reconnection or disconnection fees. People can&#39;t be productive, hard-working, taxpaying citizens if they&#39;re sick or dead. As legislators, you have a responsibility to protect Virginians from harm whenever and wherever you can. Please pass HB1054.

I also strongly favor HB600. As we&#39;ve seen in the pandemic, people can&#39;t always control when, why, or how they find themselves unemployed. And when they&#39;re suddenly thrown out of work, I feel that giving them a lifeline to help them get back on their feet is money well spent for all of us. 

And I strongly advocate for HB447. Elected officials make a lot of noise about broadband access for Virginians, but rarely do anything about it. In exchange for their monopoly control over large swaths of the state, broadband providers need to serve the public interest by offering affordable plans.

                Thank you to the Chair for allowing me this opportunity. My name is Claudia and I am speaking as a concerned resident of Falls Church. I am expressing my support for HB 1054. I live and volunteer with working-class families in a community that neighbors the middle class Lake Barcroft community. The families I know are worried about affording next month’s rent, and this bill would mean that families are not forced to live without utilities due to non-payment during times of crisis. Access to utilities creates healthy home environments and helps prevent the spread of colds, the flu, and COVID. We can’t control weather, but we can expand access to water, gas, and electricity during extreme conditions. This will strengthen the health of VA’s neighborhoods. Finally, with this testimony, I ask the subcommittee to support HB 1054.

                Some of our neighbors most impacted and financially burdened by utility bills and times of emergency are those in low-income families and communities of color. HB 1054 expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis.

                My name is Kidest Gebre and I am the Organizing Coordinator and Communicating Our Power Fellow for Virginia Interfaith Power &amp; Light, we collaborate among people of faith and conscience to grow healthy communities by advancing climate and environmental justice. 

We urge you to support HB 1054. This legislation is important to many of our faith communities. Many faith communities in Virginia offer social services to help pay bills like food, rent, and utility bills (water, electricity, and gas) for families in need and offer life-saving support. As people of faith, this past Sunday, over 75 faith communities and households in Virginia stood in solidarity with the many vulnerable Virginians who are living in danger of utility disconnections this winter.

We’ve had faith leaders, express that the members of their congregation “who live paycheck to paycheck lose their power due to late payments. That means their food spoils in the fridge and their kids can’t access the internet for school. Utilities are too vital for people who are already living on the edge to lose.”  This bill gives folks the extra time and the proper time of delay from disconnections during times of public health emergency and extreme weather.  Thank you!

                As the impacts of climate change worsen, extreme weather events are predicted to be more frequent and severe, likely affecting our most vulnerable neighbors. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that just last year deadly weather such as flooding events, extreme heat, tornadoes, and cyclones cost $145 billion, the third-highest cost on record, and killed more than 600 people.

                Virginia’s climate is rapidly changing. The United States Environmental Protection Agency explains how Virginia’s sea level has risen from one to two inches every decade.  With Higher water levels, Virginia residents are experiencing extreme weather conditions like eroding beaches, submerging lowlands, and exacerbating coastal flooding. Bill HB1054 is essential because it  provides protections for our neighbors at higher risk of being affected by extreme weather events, ensures life-saving access to those who need gas, electric, and water services the most, and bans utilities from charging households for disconnecting and reconnecting their accounts.  Hence, CCAN Action Fund supports this bill HB1054.
