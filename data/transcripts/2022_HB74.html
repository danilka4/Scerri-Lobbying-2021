                 EITE, formerly known as Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed Industries are prone to releasing excessive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, and become energy intensive. By exempting these companies from non-bypassable charges related to the development of renewable energy, it can result in smaller businesses/residential customers within Virginia becoming faced with a larger burden of costs as Virginia transitions to a carbon free energy sector. And it is for these reasons, NRDC opposes this bill HB74.

RE: Virginia Businesses Support the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Regional Greenhouse Gas Program (RGGI), and Clean Cars 

Dear Chair Byron and Members of the House Commerce and Energy Committee: 

Ceres is a nonprofit organization working with major companies and investors to build economic solutions to climate issues. We write today to share the position of the business community in Virginia on the bills before the Committee that propose to modify the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) as well as Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Advanced Clean Cars (&quot;Clean Cars&quot;) program. Members of Ceres BICEP Network* with operations in Virginia include Adobe, Ball Corporation, IKEA, JLL, Kaiser Permanente, Lyft, Mars Inc., McDonald’s, Microsoft, Nestle, Salesforce, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries. 

As large employers and energy users, businesses understand how Virginia’s energy policy affects the cost of doing business. Maintaining market-friendly climate policies like the VCEA, RGGI and Clean Cars will enable Virginia to make critical progress on pollution and decarbonization while investing in a competitive, resilient economy. The VCEA is an attractive policy for companies looking to power their operations with renewable energy to make investments in Virginia. Energy efficiency and renewable standards keep energy costs low, consistent, and predictable over the long-term, allowing companies to plan ahead. That’s why 97 companies in Virginia have committed to power all of their corporate operations with 100% renewable energy. Continuing to participate in RGGI will ensure that state’s clean energy transition includes critical financial support to vulnerable coastline communities through flood mitigation programs and to vulnerable households statewide through funding for low-income energy efficiency programs. Further, predictable, stable energy policy sends a signal to new businesses that Virginia is a good place to invest. 

On behalf of seven businesses and four higher education institutions, I am pleased to share the attached letter urging the Virginia Legislature to maintain and build upon the considerable progress made in recent years to confront the climate crisis and build a competitive in-state clean energy market. The following companies, Hannon Armstrong, Lutron, Mars, Inc., Nestlé, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries, and higher-ed institutions Sweet Briar College, University of Lynchburg, Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, and Virginia Wesleyan University share their support in the letter for the VCEA, RGGI, and Clean Cars, citing the significant business benefits of these policies, such as lower energy costs, new in-state investments, and programs that will help them meet their own climate goals. The signatories urge legislators to maintain a hospitable environment for clean energy investments going forward. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, and please be in touch with any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Mel Mackin 
Manager, State Policy
Ceres

*The Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (“BICEP”) Network is a group of nearly 80 companies that support policies to prevent the dire financial and material risks of the climate crisis. BICEP members are committed to advocating for stronger climate and clean energy policies at the state and federal levels.

                AdvanSix is a leading manufacturer of Nylon 6, a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce fibers, filaments, engineered plastics and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as PPE, ventilator tubing, carpets, automotive and electronic components, sports apparel, food packaging and other industrial applications. It is also the world’s largest single-site producer of ammonia sulfate fertilizer with on-site agronomists and technical support.  Several of the products produced by ASIX have been deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security.

In Virginia, AdvanSix operates two large Virginia operations with more than 1,200 employees in Hopewell and Chesterfield.

AdvanSix supports House Bill 74 by Del. Ware.   We compete internationally on the Nylon 6 market and are an energy-intensive trade-exposed industry (EITE).  Preventing economic risk to Virginia EITE industries which face higher energy costs due to climate change regulation/legislation will avoid “emissions leakage” to more carbon-intensive competitors (foreign and domestic). The U.S. American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454 – 2009) established a structure whereby emission allowances to qualified EITE industries would counter economic risks against major competitors that have no Green House Gas emission caps.

                VCEA:

Is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.

Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.

Will hit poorer families the hardest.

Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.

Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

                This is terribly detrimental to the economy and to all Virginians.  This does nothing but raise energy prices for consumers AND cause severe environmental damage!  

Please don&#39;t allow Virginia to become a third world country this way.  Please reject this piece of legislation entirely.

                The climate has been changing for the past 4.7 billion years since the Earth came into being. Polymath climatologists, such as Dick Lindzen (MIT) &amp; Will Happer (Princeton &amp; former research leader at the Dept. of Energy) , have  both stated that the impact of anthropogenic climate change due to CO2 is so minuscule as to not even be measurable. In short, massive Government funds going to address climate change are an absurd waste of money &amp; time. It is not based on science but on faulty &amp; inadequate climate models which are loaded with assumptions. The biggest green house gas by a country mile is water : vapor &amp; clouds; it swamps CO2 &amp; can’t be properly measured. And natural forces are the key to the changing climate. In fact, ice core data have shown that tropospheric CO2 when dinosaurs were around some 65 million years ago (of which some 40% were herbivores) &amp; lots of greenery was needed as food, were as high as 9000 ppmV. And we are worried about 420 ppmV currently. It is scientifically insane. Furthermore, models are not data. And global temperatures, when dinosaurs inhabited the Earth,  were similar to that of today despite exceptionally high CO2 levels. If we ignore properly determined data &amp; evidence there is no Plan B. Peter

                VCEA is not just a Virginia issue. Everywhere where government has shuttered efficient fossil fuel energy sources and forced people into wind and solar prices have risen, the environment suffers, and reliability is destroyed. VCEA:
•	Is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.
•	Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.
•	Will hit poorer families the hardest.
•	Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.
•	Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.
•	Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

                EITE, formerly known as Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed Industries are prone to releasing excessive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, and become energy intensive.  By exempting these companies from non-bypassable charges related to the development of renewable energy, it can result in smaller businesses/residential customers within Virginia becoming faced with a larger burden of costs as Virginia transitions to a carbon free energy sector. And it is for these reasons, CCAN Action Fund opposes this bill HB74.
