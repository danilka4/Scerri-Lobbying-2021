                Dear Delegate,
Please think about the many flood disasters Virginia stands to get and begin to protect our most vulnerable people in the flood plain with concrete infrastructure  and pumps..  Funding their recovery does not provide protection for everyone, for the community, and doesn’t change anything  about the flooding which will just come back again.  Do not vote for #5.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Frances Lee-Vandell

                I strongly urge the committee to defeat HB 5, HB 1261, &amp; HB 1301.   HB 1261 would repeal Virginia residents’ participation in important environmental decisions. Public input and public participation in environmental discussions are critical to raising issues of safety, health, social and economic impact, and whether the siting of a project is suitable for the location in which it is proposed.   HB 1301 will hinder Virginia&#39;s progress toward a clean economy by repealing Virginia&#39;s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Virginia&#39;s participation in RGGI is a successful effort to reduce pollution while directly helping communities on the front lines.   HB 5 diverts funding from the Community Flood Preparedness Fund (FUND) and creates a Flood Relief Fund. This is an inappropriate use of the RGGI funds. The existing FUND is already helping thousands of low-wealth families reduce energy bills and climate impacts, and localities deal with increasingly devastating floods.   As a person of conscience, it is essential to oppose bills like HB 5, HB 1261, &amp; HB 1301, which will set Virginians backward in our goal to address the impacts of climate change and reach carbon-free energy by 2050.&quot;

                I oppose the passage of these bills.  We again, face a political opposition to taking care of our own and our environment in these bills.  I am particularly dismayed when those proposing these laws claim to be Christians.  In fact, passing these bills will ensure that we do the very opposite of what is a truly moral or Christian act.  It brings to mind the passage in Matthew 25:34-45.  Indeed if we claim that we have a moral authority of any kind - then we will not rescind our participation in the Greenhouse Gas Initiative, will not ensure that our environmental aspirations of caring for not only the Earth but those living in it then what can we truly say of ourselves as a state and a country?  I do not want to hear about the economic costs.  That is only a smokescreen to protect the proponents of this law from having to live with the consequences of passing these laws.  It really does come down to having a commitment to something far greater and more important than ourselves as individuals or our investments and bank accounts.  It is a matter of irreversible damage that cannot be undone once we have stepped over the place of no return.  Lastly,  if any claim pro-life - these laws destroy any credibility of those who stand by that position.

                Supplemental Comments for full committee consideration:
The comment was made in Subcommittee that Virginia is the only state in which a citizen Board makes permit decisions.  This is not true.  However, if its were true, that would not mean that the Commonwealth&#39;s approach is less desirable.  We are the only state in which a Governor cannot seek a second consecutive term.  Is this bad?  Some say yes, some say no.  It&#39;s just different.

While opponents implied that any decision that deviated from DEQ&#39;s recommendation would be unscientific, the nature of changes to DEQ&#39;s recommendations are not about &quot;science.&quot;  DEQ&#39;s rationale, including science, economics, practicality, etc. are almost always followed and are always considered.  DEQ is not infallible, however.  In every case during my 10+ years on the Water Board applicants were asked about whether they would be amenable to changes suggested  by a Board member and those responses were carefully considered by the Board.  This is part of the beauty of open decision-making. 

Proponents of the Bill did not give one specific example of a problem caused by a decision of the Water Board.  All arguments for the legislation were general, not specific.  It is reasonable to ask what problem the bill solves before deciding whether it has merit.

The Board has had appointees from both parties, rural and urban areas, all geographic regions.  Member have had careers in industry, agriculture, law, science, and environmental policy.  This diversity of experience is another strength of Virginia&#39;s approach.

In my experience, Board members strive to be apolitical, uphold Virginia’s laws and regulations, and serve the public as well as the regulated community, all in the interest of the Commonwealth.  While day to day operations of DEQ are delegated to the Director, the Citizens boards provide the only opportunity for public hearings on environmental permits that impact the public’s surface water, ground water, wetlands, and air resources. Permit hearings and Board meetings provide the only peak behind the curtain; i.e., the only means of transparency and accountability for a governmental bureaucracy that has a significant impact on the lives of Virginia residents. While it has been extremely rare for a Citizen board to ever reject a recommendation by DEQ staff, it is not rare for Board members to suggest improvements to permit conditions that resolve contentious issues that impact neighbors or the public. I note that in the almost 9 years that I served on the SWCB, I never saw Delegate Bloxom attend any SWCB meeting so that he could see first hand  the important work of the citizen board in the permit review process . I urge this committee to reject this proposal as it would be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth in protecting the integrity, efficacy and public policy related to the relevant environmental permits.

                AdvanSix is a leading manufacturer of Nylon 6, a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce fibers, filaments, engineered plastics and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as PPE, ventilator tubing, carpets, automotive and electronic components, sports apparel, food packaging and other industrial applications. It is also the world’s largest single-site producer of ammonia sulfate fertilizer with on-site agronomists and technical support.  Several of the products produced by ASIX have been deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security.
In Virginia, AdvanSix operates two large Virginia operations with more than 1,200 employees in Hopewell and Chesterfield.
AdvanSix supports HB 1261 which reforms the appointment process and authority of the VA DEQ Water Pollution Control Board, Air Pollution Control Board, and Waste Management Board. The reforms will ensure that members picked by the Administration and legislature are qualified to serve and removes the Board’s ability to issue any environmental permit or abridge or deny any environmental permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality. Virginia is the only state in the US that gives this level of authority to bypass an environmental agency. Virginia is out of step with the nation, especially RGGI states. The reforms promote regulatory predictability and certainty and greatly curtail any political agendas - all necessary to maintain Virginia&#39;s competitiveness.

                I strongly oppose bill HB1261,  which would repeal permitting authority from the state environmental boards. These boards have relevant expertise in their subject areas and provide the public with opportunities to comment on pending decisions. It would be foolish to eliminate their important role in reviewing permit applications.

                I served two terms on the Water Board, appointed by different Governors.  This bill seems to be a &quot;solution&quot; in search of a problem.  Decision-making by a non-partisan citizen board assures that the public is heard, can be present when a decision is made, and hears the basis for action by Board Members.  The Water Board usually adopts DEQ&#39;s recommendation, but sometimes that recommendation is changed through the discussion among the applicant, DEQ and the Board. Rarely the Board will make significant changes to permit terms or deny a permit. This public process builds understanding and acceptance of decisions.  Board members, who have a variety of perspectives and expertise, come from all areas of the Commonwealth.   Decision making by the Water Board does not add a significant amount of time to permit processing.  Many dischargers in the Commonwealth are covered by General Permits.  Individual permits for large volume dischargers are sometimes controversial and the fact that a Citizen Board considers the permit can add a degree of acceptance to the final decision that action by DEQ might not enjoy.  Since Board Members are not compensated, there is not significant cost savings to be realized by transferring permit responsibility to DEQ.  I hope to testify in person or virtually and would welcome any questions about my comments.

                I support the Humane Society of the United States&#39; positions pertaining to your particular bill(s).  I do believe HSUS adheres to and promotes the highest standards of integrity in the issues of animal issues, the environment, human concerns, et. al.   I hope you can vote with that perspective in mind.

                Good Afternoon,
I am submitting my support of the above items. I strongly   feel that we need  to put more time and planning on what  we are doing to our animals, that are due the same respect as we all inhabits of our planet, and out planet. We only have one earth and we have not been responsible on how we treated her.
