                Virginia currently has one of the weakest utility disconnection protections for customers of any of any state in the Southeast. This includes for households containing the very young, seniors, and people with disabilities or medical conditions.  HB664 expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis. This bill
protects the access to essential utility services for populations that are socially and medically vulnerable.

                During emergency periods like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, access to public utilities such as electricity, water, and sewage service is absolutely vital for maintaining public health and community stability. 

Temporary moratoriums on utility shutoffs are certainly helpful. A working paper published last year by the National Bureau for Economic Research estimated that COVID-related deaths could have been reduced by almost 15% had there been a nationwide moratorium on shutoffs.

However, it should not require an unprecedented pandemic to provide Virginia residents with protection from harmful utility shutoffs. Medical emergencies of all types happen every day to people and families in our commonwealth, and these families should have the security of reliable access to public utilities during their time of hardship. 

Let us be a commonwealth that puts the health and security needs of our families above the revenue needs of utility corporations. Please pass HB 664.

                Good afternoon. My name is Connie  Wright-Zink and I live in Augusta County. I am here as an individual, a member of Virginia Organizing and the coalition of community activists that collaborated to help write this bill. 

This bill is not new legislation, but amends already existing protections against utility disconnections for vulnerable members of our community. 

There are many vulnerable groups who could be severely impacted by losing power during emergency situations. One such group with which I have personal connections is the deaf and hard of hearing. I have worked extensively with the deaf community to improve communication access at our local hospital, Augusta Health in Fishersville. Without protections against losing power the deaf community loses their ability to communicate with emergency service providers. 

Another personal example of how losing power during an emergency is what happens to people who depend on the assistance of breathing equipment like CPAP machines. My husband uses this equipment and in addition to needing it to sleep, our insurance company requires a minimum number of hours a night in order for them to cover the high cost of the machine.

In closing, I would like to highlight the fact that Virginia’s utility disconnection policy for households including medically
vulnerable people is over a decade old, and is among the weakest compared to other states in
the region [1].
● South Carolina, Maryland, Georgia and Mississippi each offer more protection for
vulnerable customers, including prohibiting disconnections for households that
include infants and the elderly, or by offering payment plans to help
financially-strapped customers while they retain access to essential utility service.

I hope we can count on your votes to pass this bill so that we can join other states in the Southeast in protecting our most vulnerable citizens. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.

                The Virginia State Conference NAACP is in full support of HB664.  According to the NAACP&#39;s, Lights Out In The Cold, the report presented a comprehensive overview of utility disconnection and the human cost associated with these practices. it was determined that changes must be made to incorporate human rights into the utility business model to ensure that all individuals has the human right to safe, sustainable energy, particularly during personal and otherwise emergency events.  

Virginian&#39;s, during vulnerable times, should not be at risk at losing access to life-sustaining utilities such as water and electricity, due to non-payment. Black households are 3Xs more likely to experience utility disruptions, and we must protect our elderly, those with disabilities, our children, and infirm at any opportunity and this is one of those times.


I urge you to please vote yes on HB664

                Hello, my name is Ronna Wertman and I am a lifelong resident of Augusta County. I am writing as a citizen in support of HB 664. HB 664 updates current utility disconnection policies to take into consideration customers and households that have medical conditions, disabilities and chronic illnesses, and households with elders and/or infants. These households need access to reliable, essential utility services - water and power - to stay alive and are often the ones most impacted by limited income and quality housing. I remember the shock and embarrassment of having our water turned off when I was in elementary school. My mother, who is deaf, was doing her absolute best for our family after escaping a horrific domestic violence situation. I’ve never forgotten it. Utility cut-offs through no fault of your own take away dignity. HB 664 aims to extend current existing delays from 30 to 60 days, applying to all regulated gas, electric, and water utilities. Households with infants will be able to seek a delay up to 60 days following notice of service termination for non-payment. And importantly, customers with serious medical conditions will also have access to extended 60 day protections from service terminations. Some of Virginia’s utility disconnection policies are over a decade old and are among the weakest of any in the southern United States. Please give your support to HB 664 and bring fairness and dignity to our friends and neighbors in each of our districts who need it most. Thank you.

                Please support Del. Kory&#39;s bill to stop utility shut-offs for our most vulnerable Virginians.  I participated in VA Interfaith Power &amp; Light&#39;s &quot;Lights Out Power Fast&quot; on Sunday to call out Virginia as having one of the weakest utility disconnection protections for customers of any state in the southeast – including customers who are vulnerable or medically compromised. 
●	It is critical to provide life-saving support for community members like the elderly, infants, and those who have medical conditions and/or disabilities. This bill protects access to essential utility services – water and power – for people who are socially and medically vulnerable.   
●	Some of our neighbors most impacted and financially burdened by utility bills are those in low-income families and communities of color. Black households are the most impacted by energy burdens and utility hardship—Black households are three times more likely to experience a utility service shut-off than non-blacks (15% versus 4%). This bill expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis. 

Please support this bill to protect all Virginians, especially those who have suffered the most during this pandemic and winter crises, or during the summer months of greatest heat. 

Thank you for your caring and thoughtful support of this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Rev. Dr. Lakshmi Fjord

                 HB 664 updates current protections by extending the existing delay from disconnection for customers with serious medical conditions so that it applies to (a) all regulated electric, gas and water utilities, and (b) allows households including infants (12 months and under) to delay disconnection by 60 days following the notice of service termination for non-payment. The bill also increases the right of a customer to seek delays based on these medical and socially vulnerable exemptions from 2 to 3 times in a 12-month period, and requires utilities to report on the number of delays granted.

In summary, Delegate Kory’s HB 664 …
1.	Updates the existing utility disconnection policy for medically vulnerable customers of all regulated electric, gas and water utilities.
2.	Updates eligibility requirements and allows nurse practitioners to certify that a customer qualifies for a disconnection delay due to a medical vulnerability.
3.	Lengthens the duration of the delay.

I call upon committee members to approve HB 664, not for my family members, but for those who do not enjoy the level of support that my loved ones do. Thank you for your consideration.

Joy Loving

                Say NO to the bills that take away Collective Bargaining. Employees in the state of VA deserve Collective Bargaining.  Teachers, firefighters and Policeman deserve a position in determining what happens in their profession. For too long they have had to sit back and let others who are not part of their profession, decide what happens in their profession. Give them a voice to determine what  is in the best interest for their profession. Teachers work day and night to provide what is in the best interest of students- no one knows better then they do how to achieve this- they deserve a voice in the decision-making  We will lose the best  teachers, firefighters and policemen if we take away this critical opportunity for them to have a voice  in their professions.  Say NO to the bills that take away Collective Bargaining.

                Good morning honorable members of the Committee,

Massachusetts is often said to have the strongest public schools in the nation.  Did you also know that Massachusetts Educators also have strong collective bargaining rights.  Massachusetts invests in education.  With the current staffing shortages,  show Virginia families and educators that you are in strong support of education by supporting collective bargaining rights.  Virginia educators earn 7k below the national average and many are abandoning the profession.  Can you blame them?

Sincerely

Brian McGovern

                I am asking that the committee support HB 664.  It is imperative that the Commonwealth care for its most vulnerable citizens in times of distress.  The recent extremely cold weather is a stark reminder of the cost of allowing people to have their utilities shut off during extreme weather conditions.  Please provide a system that allows these vulnerable neighbors, the very young, the elderly and those with health conditions to request delays in utility shut offs during these severe weather events.  The covid has created another significant  event that is damaging folks&#39; ability to pay their bills in a timely manner.  A system that permits delays for payments without shutting off utilities is crucial.  Thank you.  DeeDee Tostanoski

                We know what are students need more than anyone.     I work out Special Education students every day.  They always asking why do we have to do this or that.  They ask why people who don&#39;t know them make them take test they know that they will pass.  I want to speak for these students who fight a different type of battle every day.  Let us who know what to do have a say.  Most of you have no idea what special needs children fights every day because you have never been around my students.

                Please vote YES on HB 664 to expand the *delay of disconnections* for all utilities.  Our neighbors who are vulnerable to utility disconnection require the protection this bill would provide!  There are households whose residents include very young children, persons with medical vulnerabilities, and seniors who are not protected from disconnection, even during weather extremes.  Please VOTE YES on HB 664.

                These bills will repeal educators&#39; progress toward gaining collective bargaining. They will silence educators&#39; voices. School decisions will not be able to capitalize on the experiences and skills of their experts in their school systems, the educators. Why deny educators a seat at the table? Why squelch expert input? Educators are the experts in our schools. Bargaining with educators benefits our students&#39; learning conditions. It improves educator working conditions, and ultimately benefits our Virginia communities.

Bring the experts to the table. 

I urge you to vote no on these bills.
Sincerely,

              </p>

                This legislation is important to me and would make it possible to expand Virginia&#39;s existing protection from utility disconnections. Virginia currently has among the weakest utility disconnection protections for customers of any state in the southeast – including customers who are
vulnerable or medically compromised. As a person of conscience, it is critical to provide life-saving support for community members like the elderly, infants, and those who have medical conditions. Support HB 664 and protect access to essential utility services – water and power – for people who are socially and medically vulnerable

                The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that while employment is rising and strains on household budgets have eased in recent months, the employment rate remains below pre-pandemic levels, and millions still report that their households are not caught up on rent payments. Virginia currently has among the weakest utility disconnection protections, especially customers who are vulnerable or medically compromised. This bill protects access to essential utility services like water and power for people who are socially and medically vulnerable. This bill will extend the existing delay from service termination for serious medical conditions by 60 days following the notice of service termination for non-payment. It will  increases the right for customers to seek delays based on their medical and social vulnerability as well.  Hence, for these reasons,  CCAN Action Fund supports bill HB664.
