Shepherd,Richmond,NRDC,2022,HB73,"The Virginia Clean Economy Act was established to provide an increase in clean energy jobs and reduce Virginia's carbon emissions by expanding wind and solar power. By allowing this bill to move forward, it will eliminate incentives for utilities to develop pilot programs for the state. Pilot programs play an important role by encouraging new and innovative approaches to energy efficiency programs. Such programs provided by the VCEA help Virginia populations save money and obtain essential access to energy sufficient projects. This bill will make it more difficult for these vulnerable Virginia populations to access energy efficiency programs that will save them money. And it is for these reasons, NRDC opposes this bill HB73."
Conrad,"Durham, NC",Strata Clean Energy,2022,HB73,"The Virginia Clean Economy Act provides major job opportunity and economic growth for the Commonwealth by including capacity requirements for clean energy sources. This bill would remove the capacity requirements within the VCEA, which would significantly slow and in many cases stop the progress of clean energy companies in the state, potentially losing tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment to Virginia. Clean energy businesses, such as Strata Clean Energy, are a major asset to the Commonwealth, bringing new jobs, local tax dollars, opportunities for landowners and providing independent energy sources. In order for clean energy companies to continue to invest and create good-paying jobs in the Commonwealth, we respectfully request the Members of the Committee vote against HB 73."

Leyen,Richmond,Virginia League of Conservation Voters,2022,HB443,"The Virginia League of Conservation Voters supports HB433, which allows local park authorities to provide electric vehicle charging services without being considered public utilities subject to State Corporation Commission regulation and rate setting.It does so by adding “park authority created by a locality” to the entities whose EV charging services don’t constitute the “retail sale of electricity” subject to SCC regulation – a list that already includes any “locality” and other person, school board, or agency that is not a public utility. Since localities are already included, it makes great sense to also include the park authorities those localities create.This won’t interfere with SCC regulation of public utilities, since the electricity consumed for EV charging by a park authority (or any other entity on the list) must be used exclusively for transportation, and must be procured from the regulated electric utility that the SCC has authorized to serve that area."

I don't have a stance on HB 351 or 1267, but I do feel it necessary to point out that a zero-emissions vehicle still drives (no pun intended) horrifically unsustainable land use patters by perpetuating suburban sprawl and can still kill a human being if it collides at 35 miles per hour.

Vassey,Richmond,Virginia Manufacturers Association,2022,HB1267,"The VMA asserts that ENERGY POLICIES are essential to ensuring sustainableeconomic growth in manufacturing, with an emphasis on reliable supply at affordable prices, conservation, increased cost-effective energy efficiency technology and programs, cost-effective distributed generation, strengthened infrastructure and investments in new technologies.  We support HB1267 and HB1301.HB1267 repeals the LEV and ZEV emission program linking Virginia to the California Air Board and establishing a pathway to the regulatory moratorium on all internal combustion engines.HB1301 repeals the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that obfuscates its actual purpose - the participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - creating an estimated $280 million and growing annual tax on electricity.Further, the VMA asserts that CLIMATE CHANGE regulations must be exclusively addressed at the Federal level.  There is an inextricable linkage between environmental management and the making and moving of energy, products and people.  As such, economic prosperity, environmental protection, business consumption and human health are interdependent necessities of the U.S. economy. Federal and state administered EPA programs and policies to regulate the economy in order to slow or stop global warming should carefully balance these competing necessities throughrigorous scientific and economic standards.  Any regulation that would impair the U.S.economy or lacks empirical and transparent measurement leading to broad scientificallyvalidated reductions in global temperatures as well as effective adaptation strategiesshould be opposed."
Gerena,North Chesterfield,Drive Electric RVA,2022,HB1267,"Drive Electric RVA opposes HB 1267. Many electric vehicle owners have shared the same experience as consumers — they had to go outside of the state to find the vehicle they wanted. Why? Auto manufacturers allocate most of their inventories of EVs to states that have committed to transportation electrification by following California's Clean Car standards. As a result, consumers in Maryland have access to many more options for EVs than Virginians currently do. (See ""Virginia Drives Electric 2020,"" pp. 17-19, https://generation180.org/virginia-drives-electric-2020-download-page/.) This has worsened during the current supply chain issues. Delaying the implementation of Clean Car standards in Virginia will only perpetuate this supply problem, pushing prices up for EVs and hobbling the growth of the market compared to other parts of the country."

Gonzalez,Charlottesville,,2022,HB1288,"HB 1288 TECHNICAL INTERVENTION This bill will allow the State Corporation Commission to set future electricity rates based on the cost of service. Currently  the SCC has arbitrary restrictions to order a decrease in rates even when the cost of providing electricity to customers has decreased. Currently,  Customers are paying more than they should for electricity and this bill can fix the problem. For example, Dominion is overcharging customers by 200 million every year, but the current provisions in the code do not allow the commission to decrease rates.  Let me give you a bit of background To establish the rates of all water and gas monopolies in the state the regulator does a forward looking analysis of rates. This analysis  basically determines  what price of water or gas customers should pay for the utility to recover all costs plus a competitive profit. If costs in the next three years  will be higher than what current rates are recovering then there is a rate increase. If costs in the next three years will be lower there is a rate decrease. The problem in Virginia is that in 2007 and 2018 Dominion and APCO wrote special rules for them that make a rate decrease practically impossible, even when rates are above costs and fair profits.Under the special rules that only apply for Dominion and APCO there are two conditions before ordering a rate cut:The first condition is that  the  SCC must do a backward looking analysis of the last three years to see how much money they collected  compared to their costs. Only if the utility overcharged in the last three years the SCC can decrease future rates.  But then there is a second condition. Dominion can choose to recover the cost of specific projects with the money they overcharged in the past. If  these projects cost is higher than the overcharges the SCC can not decrease rates. Every time, the utility can choose to use the overcharges to pay for  projects with a higher value than overcharges and prevent a rate cut.This bill will get rid of these two barriers allowing the SCC to set lower rates that reflect  lower costs of service looking forward. This is how all investor owned water and natural gas utilities are currently regulated and it is how APCO and Dominion were regulated before 2007. There is no justification to keep these barriers to rate cuts when Dominion has been overcharging customers by at least 200 million dollars every year. Currently, customers are paying more than they should for electricity and this bill can fix the problem. "

Lowering bills is a kitchen table issue - Virginians pay the 8th highest energy bills in the country.  In the 2021 Dominion rate, the Attorney General and SCC staff demonstrated that Dominion Energy had overcharged ratepayers between $1 and $1.2 billion in excess profits over a 4-year period. SCC authority to refund ratepayers, however, was capped at $50 million.  Please protect Virginians by restoring authority to the SCC to determine fair rates.  Eliminate loopholes that enable Dominion Energy to earn beyond its statutory rate of return at the ratepayers’ expense."

Aileen,Henrico County,,2022,HB1355,"Good afternoon members of the Commerce and Energy Subcommittee;I am asking you to please support the HB 1355 Fossil Fuel Moratorium bill that is front of you today.  Any serious effort to address the climate emergency we are facing must contain a full Moratorium on all new Fossil Fuel projects in Virginia.We need an environmental bill that protects transitioning workers. Delegate Kory’s bill includes the development of transition assistance programs for workers and communities associated with the fossil fuel industry.Our communities will be protected from unnecessary fossil fuel infrastructure while establishing a just energy transitionVirginia takes pride in promoting moving towards a more sustainable economy.  A sustainable future is of great economic importance. Fossil fuels have consequences on the three pillars of sustainable development. In a study  entitled ""the social and economic consequences of the fossil fuel supply chain: “Fuels are resources that can be used to ﬁll the needs of society. So it would intuitively follow that an abundance of these resources would lead to improved economies and more stable nations. But this is in fact clearly not the case for oil & gas resources. Of the 34 countries who are able to derive more than 5% of their GDP from oil exports, only 9 are ranked as stable nations”https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/mre.2016.7We can cite lots more cases of the instability that fossil fuel has proven to bring to our state.

Aguilar,"Washington, DC",Food & Water Watch,2022,HB1355,"January 31, 2022SUPPORT HB 1355: Fossil fuel projects moratoriumOn behalf of Food & Water Watch’s nearly 30,000 members, we want to urge the committee to vote in favor of passing HB 1355 so that a moratorium is put in place to stop the development of new fossil fuel projects in Virginia.Over the past several years, Virginia has continued to permit that buildout of fossil fuel power plants and infrastructure.  Natural gas powered facilities, pipelines, compressor stations and other infrastructure project, in particular, have been proposed across numerous communities in the state.  These projects have brought with them health and safety concerns, violation of property rights, and the degradation of the environment.A moratorium on new fossil fuel projects is needed now because Virginia has pledged to move to 100% clean energy in the next few decades and the state should be putting all of its emphasis on the development of truly clean options.  As the costs for renewables also continue to decrease, the continued development of fossil fuels would mean higher costs for Virginians and an exponential increase in utility rates in the long run. A 2019 independent analysis written by Advanced Clean Energy Economy also found that an ambitious scenario for moving to 100% ‘carbon zero’ by 2030 in Virginia produces “the greatest benefits in terms of GDP, job growth,  and labor income” when compared with modeling for continued reliance on fossil fuels and other less ambitious clean energy options.Finally, state legislators need to address the climate crisis head on now and take on the fossil fuel industry that are the main drivers of climate change. Increasing our dependence on and use of fossil fuels with new dirty energy projects would only exacerbate the negative impacts of climate change. Virginia is already seeing these impacts regularly in the form of flooding, snow storms, aquifer depletion, and a host of other environmental disasters that are costing hundreds of millions in damages and in efforts to mitigate the scope of the problem.For all of these reasons, Food & Water Watch urges you to vote to pass HB 1355 as favorable."

While millions of dollars from the VW settlement  have been spent by Virginia to install EV charging stations and millions more have been invested by companies like Electrify America and ChargePoint, much of that infrastructure is being concentrated along travel corridors and in highly retailed metro areas. We need to encourage private investment in underserved areas, including rural communities and low-to-moderate income neighborhoods that have relatively less retail development. This will help bring the benefits of transportation electrification to the communities who need it the most but will likely be ignored by market forces. The Driving Decarbonization Program and Fund would contribute to more equitable charging access by reserving about one quarter of annual funding for grants in historically economically disadvantaged communities, as well as offering increased grants of up to 70% of the developer’s non-utility costs for charger installation in these areas."

Patwardhan,Fairfax County,,2022,HB351,"I support HB 1029 and 311, and 323. I oppose HB 189. I have concerns about HB 314 and 491 - namely, why does being ""commercially significant"" exempt a non-native plant from being deemed a noxious weed? I am also concerned about HB 351. I agree that encouraging motorists to choose electric vehicles is a worthy goal, but I am concerned about the emphasis on simply transitioning to electric cars when cars and the infrastructure they require, well beyond just gasoline, are themselves the problem. It isn't just about emissions, it's about the asphalt - impervious surface that aggravates flooding and heating - required to park a car regardless of how ""clean"" it is. It's about the unsustainable land use patterns that even clean cars necessitate. Investing in rail, sidewalks, bike paths, and diverse zoning is a far better use of resources than simply putting more electric vehicle charging stations."
Fritz,Arlington,,2022,HB351,"Our lands and the animals that live on our lands should be protected at every cost. At a time when deforestation and the killing of animals in the U.S. and around the world  grows more and more, it is imperative to fight against this. If we do not take action and push legislation to protect our land and the animals that live on them, in the not to distant future they will become less and less until they are no more. Please think about this and help to do what you can to make positive change. "

Barbara Adams,"Richmond, VA",Richmond Interfaith Climate Justice League,2022,HB469,"Respected Committee members.The signs are everywhere - more and more severe weather events, sea level rise on the eastern shores, reduction in aquifer water tables due to reduced rain/snow fall, alarming reductions in the number, variety and health of wildlife species, asthma and COPD now common for more children and adults, cancer clusters that defy merely individual behavior, shocking data of increased levels and kinds of toxic substances found in air, land and water. These are just the tip of the melting iceberg that indicates that our world is decaying on our watch. Regardless of our faith beliefs are, or if we follow no religious path, it is clear that humans carry the burden of responsibility for the dramatic degradation of the natural world of which we are a part and, as mature, responsible adults, it is on us to make the important and necessary changes to address our actions. We are called to do this as individuals and work with our neighbors and in our community to act - to reduce consumption and pollution, make conscientious choices, and protect our homes from toxic health-threatening sources. As elected leaders, you are charged to consider and make those important decisions and take action on a scope that we as individuals and communities cannot. It is also clear that we cannot continue the same practices, making the same choices, allowing the historic status quo of the Commonwealth to put the needs of energy corporations and value them over people, if we want to positively address the dire circumstances we have created. For many years communities across Virginia that have been challenged by the ever-growing number of fossil fuel/natural gas infrastructure projects. This is a challenge because they did not invite, choose or want the various forms of this industry (gas fired electric plants, accompanying major pipelines and compressor station facilities) to enter their neighborhoods. These projects - illustrating Environmental injustice - are targeted in mostly lower wealth, mostly rural and mostly in communities of color. In most cases residents were not even informed properly that these projects were seeking access and permits, or in a timely manner, resulting in the often-unsurmountable difficulty to garner needed information, education about the technology, regulations, public process, and impacts to health, economic stability and well-being. Community members have made the huge contribution of their family and work time, their personal finances, endured the multiple stresses of facing down monolithic corporations and living everyday trying to protect and prevent potential losses to home, land and way of life. HB 469 identifies and puts into place the targets and guidelines for new behaviors that, as a Commonwealth, are necessary to shift to emphasize the health and well-being of people, living things and actively, effectively protect the world we inhabit. Making these shifts and identifying new goals and targets now will be wiser/easier than waiting and trying to desperately to fix something that is beyond broken. That would be a steep political task as well as a social nightmare. This bill gives a needed structure for communities to effectively protect themselves from rampant, merchant fossil fuel industrial projects and identifies what is needed for these shifts to be done in a just and fair manner. Please take a positive, proactive path and support HB 469. In Light, Barbara Adams"

This comprehensive approach considers impacts to all communities and offers a plan which would create significant economic opportunity for Virginia. Virginia could and should lead the transition to a clean energy future - it means a healthier future for everyone in the Commonwealth and a simultaneous economic benefit. The future is finite unless we take serious, actionable steps to shift away from polluting industries. Please support Delegate's Rasoul's HB 469. "
Muth,Richmond ,Third Act Virginia,2022,HB469,"Dear VA House and Energy Subcommittee,I write on behalf of the New Virginia Economy Act (NVEA) as a concerned citizen, grandparent, educator, and co-founder of Virginia Third Act, a State-wide group of over-60 folks who have time on their hands and who vote.  The NVEA is about one thing: preserving the health of our State and our planet for future generations. It is sound, comprehensive, challenging, and just. And, simply put, failure to address climate change NOW equates to increasing degradation of life quality for everyone. For example, over her lifetime, a six year old child in 2020, compared to  a six year old in 1960 will experience: 36 times as many heat waves; five times as many droughts; four times as many crop failures; many more cyclones and massive wildfires, and unimaginable human displacement and forced migrations.Climate change has a much more immediate and devastating effect on vulnerable communities and communities of color--whether that’s an African American community in Pittsylvania County where a new and unneeded compressor stations will release fine-particulate matter leading to disproportionately higher rates of asthma, lung cancer, heart attacks, and premature death; or  the people of Tangier Island, whose communities may be submerged by sea-level rise by the end of the century if current rates of warming continue.The NVEA looks out for ordinary citizens—in a truly bi-partisan way--to make sure that the transition to a green economy uplifts everyone and does not discriminate against any group. For example, many of those who currently work for the fossil fuel industry have well-paying jobs with benefits; these same workers must be assured of a transition to high quality jobs.The NVEA offers Virginia a chance to do something truly inspiring and great, to claim the mantle of leadership in the burgeoning green economy. And leadership is woefully lacking. Even after the Paris Accord and even after the pandemic, emissions in 2022-2023 will break all records and exceed 55 billion tons/year. Globally, governments spent $5.9 trillion in 2020 on fossil fuels and that number is expected to increase to 6.5 trillion in 2021. Virginia can show the country the way forward. If we do not, who will? I urge you to listen to your heart, grasp this geologically historic moment, and support HB 469.Thank you,Bill MuthRichmond "

Fjord,Charlottesville ,Union Hill Freedmen Family Research Group,2022,HB469,"I ask you to support The New Virginia Economy Act, a bill with a comprehensive, thoughtful and economically pragmatic plan to provide Virginians with healthy, sustainable and well-paying renewable energy sector jobs. Instead of fossil fuel industry jobs that expose workers to high risks of cancers and respiratory conditions from working with toxic chemicals, and injuries from fires and explosions.  Fossil fuel energy sources are outdated and cost far more to build than renewable energy, at the same time incurring enormous social and medical costs that must be calculated in economic planning. In Virginia, a coastal state, sea level rise related to rapid climate change will continue to cost billions of dollars in damages from flooding and building infrastructure to adapt to this problem.  This bill addresses the continued problem of environmental injustice in the siting of fossil fuel infrastructure in Virginia, forcing minority and low-income communities to bear the greatest costs of toxic pollution to their air, water, and soil from these energy sources. Please support this bill and be part of the economic boost from great jobs, clean air, water, and soil that will allow our communities and farm lands to be healthy starting with your actions to approve this bill. Sincerely, Lakshmi Fjord"
Little,Charlottesville,,2022,HB469,Please pass HB469 so that Virginia can lead on climate action and mitigation and do it in a just way.  HB469 puts the needs of working Virginians front and center while approaching climate change action head on.  The data says that we need to move faster than we are. This is an amazing way to do it. We need HB469 New Virginia Economy Act to prevent climate extremes from getting worse and to support the transition to clean green jobs that pay a livable family wage.
Padgett,Norfolk,self,2022,HB469,"The fossil fuel industry has received massive support from all levels of government for 100 years, this has gone too long already.  Now is the time to reverse course to favor clean energy.  HB469 is the best legislative initiative we Virginians have had for unwinding fossil fuel use – this will  attract the burgeoning industries of clean energy technologies.  Please begin the roll back of fossil fuels and vote in favor of HB469 for a better future."
Williams,Norfolkl,Mothers Out Front Norfolk Team,2022,HB469,"Please pass HB469 so that Virginia can get on the road to meeting climate change obligations to get a grip on green house gas emissions. Also, we need the jobs supported by the bill to help workers in the fossil fuel industry in the transition to jobs needed for a green economy.Living and raising a family in Norfolk for 30-plus years, there is no doubt in my mind that the waters are rising, hurricanes are more fearsome, and even rain storms can become ""bombs.""  My family has had three cars either totaled or damaged in the last 15 years because of unexpected flooding (non- hurricane, non-Nor'easter rain events.) Extreme weather events are on the rise and already causing havoc for Virginians. We need HB469 New Virginia Economy Act to prevent climate extremes from getting worse and to support the transition to clean green jobs that pay a livable family wage."
Fischer,Cave Spring,none,2022,HB469,"Please support HB469 - get our Energy Policy into THIS century!  Climate Change isn't something that is 30 years down the road.  It is happening NOW, here and everywhere else.  The tornado (never seen in the area before) several years back that almost wiped the town of Pulaski.  Derechos (straight line hurricane force winds), which we had never even heard of before, downing huge trees and causing widespread power outs that lasted for days.  More severe and frequent flooding & mudslides.  More severe and long lasting summer heat waves with dry spells killing more tress and increasing fire danger.  We had a major hail storm 2 years ago that destroyed every roof in the area, no matter now new.  The damages to people, homes, and infrastructure increase every year - we can NOT keep going ""status quo""!   Please change our Energy Policy to stop Fossil Fuels from killing us!"
Merchant,Martinsville,,2022,HB469,"Because of global warming Virginia is experiencing frequent weather related disasters.  At my own home I have had flooding due to torrential rain.   The flooding was bad enough to wash out a bridge at the end of my street.   This type of disaster had never been seen in this area, to my knowledge.   We also experienced a power outage lasting several day due to a direcho. Freak weather events will increase in frequency until we stop burning fossil fuels and convert to green energy.   Please support HB469. "
Ferguson,Albemarle County,,2022,HB469,"HB469 would save you a lot of time and money.  Instead of fighting the fossil fuel industry and the large utilities piece meal, or whack a mole, this bill would put a moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure, lay the ground for a just transition for all workers, and save us (and particularly our coastal region) from the most catastrophic and expensive consequences of  increased climate warming.  We could all get on with the change we have to make.  Yes, it's a big one.  Do we have a choice?  No.  So let's get on with it.  Please act now to lead us toward a future we can live with."
Faber,Lovettsville,,2022,HB469,"I write in support of this bill.This bill addresses what I consider are the most urgent issues facing Virginia:  climate change and economic insecurity for vulnerable communities.   This bill turns the commonwealth around, away from extractive energy sources that deplete and ruin our landscape and the health and viability of the citizens who worked them.  It turns us towards investing in renewables,  cleaning up and reinvigorating the rural communities that have been damaged by fossil fuel extraction. This bill is win/win however you slice it.  Please allow it to come to a vote!"
Graham,Midlothian,,2022,HB469,Please vote Yes on HB 469. Our environment is at the tipping point.

Lovelace,Bedford County,,2022,HB469,"I urge you to vote in support of HB469, the New Virginia Economy Act.The renewable energy market is ever-increasing with some of the fastest growing jobs, and Virginia should be taking every opportunity to build a renewable energy economy.  HB469 provides the pathway to building a just energy economy that would result in thousands of new jobs while protecting ratepayers from having to pay for expensive and unnecessary fossil fuel projects.  It installs protections for workers impacted by the transition, and it directs the development of a plan with input from all stakeholders to address the impacts of climate change and guide the energy transition.  This bill is critical for Virginia’s future, both economically and environmentally.Again, I urge to vote in support of HB469."
Hindle,Vienna,,2022,HB469,"As a high school student that plans to stay for college and beyond in Virginia, this bill is extremely important to me. Making the transition to clean energy is not an easy path, but it is definitely the right one. I live a stone’s throw away from 66, and I see firsthand the negative impacts of fossil fuel pollution. This bill has the power to stop the continuing investment that the government has been making into fossil fuel infrastructure and to start transitioning to more sustainable sources. We can’t live on fossil fuels forever, and it’s time to make room for more jobs in the clean energy industry before we run out of fossil fuels. "
Schlecht,"Great Falls, VA",,2022,HB469,"Where I live, we're already seeing the impacts of climate change in daily life, with more frequent wind storms, flooding, and hotter summers.

The C-PACE program is an economic development tool that uses private capital to fund environmentally sustainable projects for developers and building owners. Authorized at the state level, 16 Virginia localities have adopted their own C-PACE programs. Nationally, 37 other states utilize PACE as an incentive to attract investments in environmentally sustainable building projects.The energy cost savings that C-PACE provides also makes building projects more affordable and valuable, using private capital, while increasing property values and real property revenues for localities, while attracting business and capital to a community. These amendments to the C-PACE legislation will create greater clarity of the program’s elements and expand eligibility to attract more projects, investments and tax revenues.For these and other reasons, the Loudoun County Chamber respectfully requests your support for HB1325.

Transportation and poor land use account for a lot of climate change, and no serious climate plan can skip over addressing car dependence, sprawl, car culture, lawn culture, and single-use zoning. All this applies to our conception of a ""healthy community"" too. When more people walk, bike, and take transit to get around, we get healthier communities. Car culture is terrible for public health.I support HB 1346 and would like to add that there needs to be significant emphasis on NATIVE trees and efforts to root out non-native trees, many of which are actively invasive and ecologically harmful.I SUPPORT HB 548."
Shearer,Washington,eNRG - Energizing Renewable Growth in Holston Valley,2022,HB832," I urge you to open access to solar power in SWVA for people, businesses, and organizations unable to install solar on their own building . These bills (SB629/HB1634) are about fairness - restoring equity to solar access for electric customers regardless of where they live in Virginia. The General Assembly passed bipartisan legislation in 2020 (SB629/HB1634) to create a shared solar program in Virginia. This program is important to provide fair customer access to solar regardless of income level, building ownership, condition, or shading, who otherwise are left out of the opportunity to adopt solar power. These bills provide new opportunities to build solar on brownfields and mine lands and create jobs in the areas where the programs are available. Critically the bills will provide local employment opportunity and attract new businesses interested in being solar-powered. Only shared solar subscribers in Dominion Energy service area receive a bill credit for their proportional output of shared solar projects. As it now stands, the law discriminates against electric customers in SWVA. The 2020 legislation had significant bipartisan support throughout the 2020 legislative session, and the bills received unanimous support in committee and on the floor before being amended by conference committee. The bills' original language included Appalachian Power Company (APCo) and Kentucky Utilities/Old Dominion Power (ODP) in the program. On 3/7/20, the conference report narrowed the definition of utility to only include Dominion, eliminating APCo and ODP customers. Shared solar is particularly needed in Southwest Virginia where coal mine land suitable for solar is not large enough to support utility-scale projects, but can support community-scale projects (1-5 MW). HB 832 (Del. Wilt) and SB 659 (Sen. Hanger and Sen. Edwards) will permit APCo and ODP customers to access the same program as Dominion customers. Customers in Southwest Virginia deserve the same fair and equal access to solar programs and the associated jobs and economic benefits as are currently available to customers in other parts of the state. The bill simply changes the definition of utility to include all three investor-owned utilities in Virginia. Thank you for your service to Virginia and for restoring equity and fairness for Southwest Virginians."
Bentley,Salem,"Plowshare Peace Center, Roanoke",2022,HB832,"Dear Delegates,As a resident of Salem, I urge you to support HB832 today so as to allow solar energy sharing in other parts of the state other than those served by Dominion, like where I live. I am a retired professor who has taught courses in meteorology and climate many times in my career and am up on the science. We are in a climate emergency and we must make alternative sources of energy available to citizens in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is a step in the right direction. Please do the right thing for the western part of our Commonwealth."
Elmes,Buchanan County,Shared Solar,2022,HB832,"My husband and I have long been interested in providing some of our electrical needs by use of solar energy. After looking into the feasibility of installing rooftop solar panels and finding our heavily wooded surroundings do not provide enough daily sunlight, we sought info about shared solar community projects. We are sold on the idea that by subscribing to and paying through monthly energy bills, we could benefit, along with our neighbors and community, from a shared community solar energy offered by one’s local power company. The problem in Southwest Virginia, however, is that our Appalachian Power Company has not made this option available to us. Because Southwest Virginia utilities are not required to provide the option, we can participate in this win-win program for power companies and their customers. Therefore, we strongly urge you to support legislation HB 832 and SB 659 in favor of legally requiring public utilities companies to offer the shared solar option to all customers, thereby providing the possibility of more jobs, industrial growth, and solar access to everyone, including schools and businesses, low-income residents who live in apartments or multi-family housing, or people like us who have too many trees! Such action will also support one of the Virginia Department of Energy’s stated primary goals for addressing climate change and energy diversification."
Elmes,Buchanan County,,2022,HB832,"As a scientist, I’ve read about climate change and global warming since the 1980’s. It has taken almost a lifetime for the nations of the world to recognize that these things are actually happening and changing our world in a negative way. Any efforts to slow, stop, and reverse these changes that are taking place that are not themselves negatively impacting the environment should be adopted in order to save our planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come. There is no choice if we are to be stewards of the earth.Many people nationwide live in housing situations that are not conducive to embracing solar as an alternative energy source—they live in shaded areas, or don’t have land and monies to install solar arrays, or they live in apartments with no ownership of the buildings—but as caring stewards they would willingly do so if given the opportunity.That is why passage of HB 832 and SB 659 is so important to residents of southwest Virginia. It affords residents in the region the option to utilize solar energy for their needs via their existing electric suppliers. In particular Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power that currently do not provide this option to their customers.As a long-time southwest Virginia resident, who wants to help preserve our earth for future generations, I implore you to vote in support of this legislation."

Shared solar programs allow customers who rent, who don't have a solar-friendly roof or who can't afford their own array to purchase solar energy from a 3rd-party owned project that's typically fairly small (often in the 1-2 MW range). These programs are currently being developed for customers of Dominion Energy but Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power do not allow shared solar in their service areas, and I believe this is a significant inequity for folks in SWVA, including in Montgomery County where I live. Shared solar is a cleaner and cheaper energy resource, and more people should be able to pursue it.  Please help make this opportunity available to us!"

Leyen,Richmond,Virginia League of Conservation Voters,2022,HB520,"The Virginia League of Conservation Voters supports HB520 and HB1346.Reasons to SUPPORT HB 520:- HB520 encourages localities to adopt resilience strategies within their comprehensive plans including strategies to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to changing conditions and hazardous events.- Although current provisions in the Virginia Code currently require some Tidewater localities to include guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to foster the sustainability of shoreline resources; and for Hampton Roads Planning District Commission localities to incorporate strategies to combat sea level rise and recurrent flooding, all localities within Virginia are being impacted by stronger storms and subsequent flood events.- HB 520 is one of a suite of bills proposed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission intended to integrate statewide flooding and resilience planning and implementation across the Commonwealth in a comprehensive manner.Reasons to SUPPORT HB 1346:50,000 acres of forest and non-urban tree canopy are converted to other land uses per year in Virginia due to timber harvest, urbanization, agricultural expansion, and other drivers.These bills are the result of the months’ long stakeholder advisory group representing local government, home builders, commercial builders, agriculture, conservation members and Department of Forestry.The legislation prioritizes on-site tree preservation and replanting but affords some opportunities to meet canopy requirements in nearby under-resourced communities—including formerly redlined neighborhoods—to help offset urban heat islands. The bills also allow larger tree canopies to be required when development occurs in areas with existing enhanced tree canopies or when a locality agrees to a somewhat reduced local parking lot, setbacks, and similar requirements."
Steinhilber,Virginia Beach,Environmental Defense Fund,2022,HB520,"Environmental Defense Fund strongly supports both HB 520 and HB 364.  HB 520 encourages localities to adopt resilience strategies within their comprehensive plans including strategies to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to changing conditions and hazardous events. Although current provisions in the Virginia Code currently require some Tidewater localities to include guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to foster the sustainability of shoreline resources; and for Hampton Roads Planning District Commission localities to incorporate strategies to combat sea level rise and recurrent flooding, all localities within Virginia are being impacted by stronger storms and subsequent flood events. Therefore, HB520 proposes that all localities should include resilience strategies in their comprehensive plans.  Similarly, Environmental Defense Fund supports HB 364, which adds climate resilience as a subject to be included in regional plans created by planning district commissions. Assessing climate vulnerabilities and opportunities for resilience as a key initial step to developing long-term adaptation strategies that will allow Virginian communities and businesses to thrive in the midst of climate impacts."
Patwardhan,Fairfax County,,2022,HB520,"I support HB 364, 520, and 1276 and would like to add that LAND USE must be part of our conception of ""climate resiliency"". Transportation and poor land use account for a lot of climate change, and no serious climate plan can skip over addressing car dependence, sprawl, car culture, lawn culture, and single-use zoning. All this applies to our conception of a ""healthy community"" too. When more people walk, bike, and take transit to get around, we get healthier communities. Car culture is terrible for public health.I support HB 1346 and would like to add that there needs to be significant emphasis on NATIVE trees and efforts to root out non-native trees, many of which are actively invasive and ecologically harmful.I SUPPORT HB 548."

Johnston,Richmond,Virginia Interfaith Power and Light,2022,HB664,"Virginia currently has one of the weakest utility disconnection protections for customers of any of any state in the Southeast. This includes for households containing the very young, seniors, and people with disabilities or medical conditions.  HB664 expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis. This billprotects the access to essential utility services for populations that are socially and medically vulnerable."
Gruber,Arlington,Virginia People’s Party,2022,HB664,"During emergency periods like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, access to public utilities such as electricity, water, and sewage service is absolutely vital for maintaining public health and community stability. Temporary moratoriums on utility shutoffs are certainly helpful. A working paper published last year by the National Bureau for Economic Research estimated that COVID-related deaths could have been reduced by almost 15% had there been a nationwide moratorium on shutoffs.However, it should not require an unprecedented pandemic to provide Virginia residents with protection from harmful utility shutoffs. Medical emergencies of all types happen every day to people and families in our commonwealth, and these families should have the security of reliable access to public utilities during their time of hardship. Let us be a commonwealth that puts the health and security needs of our families above the revenue needs of utility corporations. Please pass HB 664."
Wright-Zink,Middlebrook,Virginia Organizing,2022,HB664,"Good afternoon. My name is Connie  Wright-Zink and I live in Augusta County. I am here as an individual, a member of Virginia Organizing and the coalition of community activists that collaborated to help write this bill. This bill is not new legislation, but amends already existing protections against utility disconnections for vulnerable members of our community. There are many vulnerable groups who could be severely impacted by losing power during emergency situations. One such group with which I have personal connections is the deaf and hard of hearing. I have worked extensively with the deaf community to improve communication access at our local hospital, Augusta Health in Fishersville. Without protections against losing power the deaf community loses their ability to communicate with emergency service providers. Another personal example of how losing power during an emergency is what happens to people who depend on the assistance of breathing equipment like CPAP machines. My husband uses this equipment and in addition to needing it to sleep, our insurance company requires a minimum number of hours a night in order for them to cover the high cost of the machine.In closing, I would like to highlight the fact that Virginia’s utility disconnection policy for households including medicallyvulnerable people is over a decade old, and is among the weakest compared to other states inthe region [1].● South Carolina, Maryland, Georgia and Mississippi each offer more protection forvulnerable customers, including prohibiting disconnections for households thatinclude infants and the elderly, or by offering payment plans to helpfinancially-strapped customers while they retain access to essential utility service.I hope we can count on your votes to pass this bill so that we can join other states in the Southeast in protecting our most vulnerable citizens. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak."
Campblin,Fairfax,Green New Deal VA Coalition,2022,HB664,"The Virginia State Conference NAACP is in full support of HB664.  According to the NAACP's, Lights Out In The Cold, the report presented a comprehensive overview of utility disconnection and the human cost associated with these practices. it was determined that changes must be made to incorporate human rights into the utility business model to ensure that all individuals has the human right to safe, sustainable energy, particularly during personal and otherwise emergency events.  Virginian's, during vulnerable times, should not be at risk at losing access to life-sustaining utilities such as water and electricity, due to non-payment. Black households are 3Xs more likely to experience utility disruptions, and we must protect our elderly, those with disabilities, our children, and infirm at any opportunity and this is one of those times.I urge you to please vote yes on HB664"
Wertman,Augusta County,,2022,HB664,"Hello, my name is Ronna Wertman and I am a lifelong resident of Augusta County. I am writing as a citizen in support of HB 664. HB 664 updates current utility disconnection policies to take into consideration customers and households that have medical conditions, disabilities and chronic illnesses, and households with elders and/or infants. These households need access to reliable, essential utility services - water and power - to stay alive and are often the ones most impacted by limited income and quality housing. I remember the shock and embarrassment of having our water turned off when I was in elementary school. My mother, who is deaf, was doing her absolute best for our family after escaping a horrific domestic violence situation. I’ve never forgotten it. Utility cut-offs through no fault of your own take away dignity. HB 664 aims to extend current existing delays from 30 to 60 days, applying to all regulated gas, electric, and water utilities. Households with infants will be able to seek a delay up to 60 days following notice of service termination for non-payment. And importantly, customers with serious medical conditions will also have access to extended 60 day protections from service terminations. Some of Virginia’s utility disconnection policies are over a decade old and are among the weakest of any in the southern United States. Please give your support to HB 664 and bring fairness and dignity to our friends and neighbors in each of our districts who need it most. Thank you."

I participated in VA Interfaith Power & Light's ""Lights Out Power Fast"" on Sunday to call out Virginia as having one of the weakest utility disconnection protections for customers of any state in the southeast – including customers who are vulnerable or medically compromised. ●	It is critical to provide life-saving support for community members like the elderly, infants, and those who have medical conditions and/or disabilities. This bill protects access to essential utility services – water and power – for people who are socially and medically vulnerable.   ●	Some of our neighbors most impacted and financially burdened by utility bills are those in low-income families and communities of color. Black households are the most impacted by energy burdens and utility hardship—Black households are three times more likely to experience a utility service shut-off than non-blacks (15% versus 4%). This bill expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis. Please support this bill to protect all Virginians, especially those who have suffered the most during this pandemic and winter crises, or during the summer months of greatest heat.

Tostanoski,Alexandria,,2022,HB664,"I am asking that the committee support HB 664.  It is imperative that the Commonwealth care for its most vulnerable citizens in times of distress.  The recent extremely cold weather is a stark reminder of the cost of allowing people to have their utilities shut off during extreme weather conditions.  Please provide a system that allows these vulnerable neighbors, the very young, the elderly and those with health conditions to request delays in utility shut offs during these severe weather events.  The covid has created another significant  event that is damaging folks' ability to pay their bills in a timely manner.  A system that permits delays for payments without shutting off utilities is crucial.  Thank you.  DeeDee Tostanoski"

Please VOTE YES on HB 664."
Sullivan,Ashburn,Loudoun Education Association,2022,HB664,"These bills will repeal educators' progress toward gaining collective bargaining. They will silence educators' voices.

Tisha Erby,Richmond City,RPS,2022,HB1144,"Hello I’m Tisha Erby Mother of 5 boys , 4 are Richmond Public School Students and WE support HB 531 which will allow all counties and cities to use a 1% sales tax to pay for the construction of new schools. [RPS-George Wythe High School] needs this additional revenue to build new schools and modernize facilities to improve the learning experience of its students. According to the Virginia Department of Education, more than half of the state’s school buildings are more than 50 years old. Unfortunately, my community is home to several of these outdated buildings including George Wythe High School. Students and teachers are placed in unsafe environments that may have leaky roofs, windowless classrooms, mold, poor ventilation, and broken HVAC systems. It is not helpful to the learning environment and development of children to attend school in buildings that harm their health and well-being. Having the sales tax as an option will give us the opportunity to fix the crumbling schools in my school district. I am afraid that if the General Assembly doesn’t pass this bill, another generation of students will be forced to sit in outdated, 50-year old classrooms that are inadequate for what students need today.Please prioritize education and the future of our commonwealth by taking this necessary step to invest in our schools, our students, and our community.Thank you so much for listening and remember #WytheCantWait #AllRPSCantWait #WeAreRPS"

Farrell,"Houston, Texas",,2022,HB74,"The climate has been changing for the past 4.7 billion years since the Earth came into being. Polymath climatologists, such as Dick Lindzen (MIT) & Will Happer (Princeton & former research leader at the Dept. of Energy) , have  both stated that the impact of anthropogenic climate change due to CO2 is so minuscule as to not even be measurable. In short, massive Government funds going to address climate change are an absurd waste of money & time. It is not based on science but on faulty & inadequate climate models which are loaded with assumptions. The biggest green house gas by a country mile is water : vapor & clouds; it swamps CO2 & can’t be properly measured. And natural forces are the key to the changing climate. In fact, ice core data have shown that tropospheric CO2 when dinosaurs were around some 65 million years ago (of which some 40% were herbivores) & lots of greenery was needed as food, were as high as 9000 ppmV. And we are worried about 420 ppmV currently. It is scientifically insane. Furthermore, models are not data. And global temperatures, when dinosaurs inhabited the Earth,  were similar to that of today despite exceptionally high CO2 levels. If we ignore properly determined data & evidence there is no Plan B.

Mugg,Falls Church,,2022,HB1257,What I don't get is...why are Republicans behind it?  I thought that one of the Republican Party principles was to keep the government out of our lives.  Now it looks like Republicans are going to tell me what I can put in my kitchen!  What's next - no microwaves?  Appliances that are not made in the USA?  Where is this headed?    And Stanford just published a study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology  that shows that gas burning stoves pose a greater risk to the planet and public health than previously thought - and that 3/4 of the methane emissions occurred when the gas stoves were turned off.

Reality is different, and there is no reason to be burning methane in our homes,  polluting our indoor air, and having an extraordinary amount of this greenhouse gas escaping at every step of its delivery. This is a Koch-funded model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council and is a protectionist move for the fossil-fuel industry. They pollute for free and profit mightily with what they claim is affordable energy.  Electrification of our homes is a win for the consumer. Vote NO on HB1257.Thank  you."
Wise,"Pickens, SC",Southeast Hearth Patio and Barbecue Association,2022,HB1257,Thank you for considering Bill 1257.  I am very much in favor of the proposed bill.  This bill would prohibit municipalities from passing an ordinance or imposing a restrictive building code that would deny consumers from acquiring and or using natural gas within their boundaries. I appreciate your consideration. We need fuel choice. 
Boehmer,Richmond,Environment Virginia,2022,HB1257,"On behalf of Environment Virginia, I am urging your opposition to HB 1257. If passed, this bill would hinder communities in our state from taking action to tap into the full potential of renewable energy. This would switch Virginia from making progress on clean energy to trying to fight climate change with one hand tied behind our backs. We urge you to oppose it.All Virginians need clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and a liveable climate. In a greener, healthier world, we would conserve more, use the energy we have more wisely and efficiently and rely only on sources of energy that are clean, renewable and leave less environmental damage in their wake. To make that vision a reality, one key step is to repower our homes with clean, renewable energy. That means taking steps to replace fossil fuel-powered appliances with efficient, electric technologies. Today, electric heat pumps can heat and cool homes more efficiently and cheaply than gas or oil furnaces. Induction cook stoves heat food more efficiently, more safely and cause less indoor air-pollution than stoves that burn methane gas. In fact, installing fully electric systems in homes and commercial buildings now makes financial sense for owners in almost all new construction.Virginia has an important role to play. According to Environment America Research and Policy Center’s Electric Buildings 2021 report, completely repowering our state’s homes and businesses with electricity by 2050 would result in a reduction of 6.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of taking more than 1.4 million cars off the road. That would mean cleaner air to breathe both inside and outside, cleaner water to drink, and safer living spaces for our loved ones. The benefits of electrifying buildings coupled with the urgency of climate change make it more critical than ever that we use the tools at our disposal to make sure that the homes, office buildings and other buildings of tomorrow don’t set us up with the same problems that plague yesterday’s buildings: the environmental, health and consumer hazards of directly combusting fossil fuels in our homes and businesses for heating, cooling and cooking.If passed, this bill would slow down the deployment of clean energy technologies and keep us hooked on fossil fuels -- even if there is strong statewide support for climate action and clean energy. We need a range of tools to prepare for the future. HB 1257 would take away some of those tools by revoking our decision-makers’ ability to restrict the use of fossil fuels such as methane gas in our homes and other buildings. We urge you to oppose HB 1257 and instead choose a path that gives us a resounding say in how we power our homes, businesses and communities. Virginians should maintain our freedom to choose efficient, electric buildings, and we should continue to lead the country towards a clean, renewable energy future. We respectfully urge you to vote no on HB 1257."
Leyen,Richmond,Virginia League of Conservation Voters,2022,HB1257,"The Virginia League of Conservation Voters opposes this legislation that would preemptively prohibits all state and local government entities from preventing natural gas in new buildings, slowing the transition to clean energy.

I comment today in my professional capacity as Conservation Policy Associate for Wild Virginia, a statewide non-profit organization seeking to protect water quality for all Virginians. I urge you to support HB393 because it aims to ensure that DEQ and the Water Board consider community interests when deciding whether or not to lower the water quality of a local waterbody. Every community—rural, suburban, or urban—should be able to have a say in what happens to their local waters. Such waters provide tremendous value for local communities, including but not limited to enhanced property values for riparian and nearby landowners as well as economic benefits from water-based recreation and tourism. However, not every community has power, influence, or even reliable internet access to be able to participate in environmental decision-making. Accordingly, HB393 seeks to ensure that DEQ and the Water Board do not overlook the interests of local communities and the impacts of lowered water quality on these communities. HB393 seeks to achieve this outcome by expressly including a socio-economic analysis requirement in the statutory text. Importantly, HB393 does not create a new, substantive duty for DEQ or the Water Board; rather, it reiterates an existing obligation. Nonetheless, I urge you to support HB393 because although DEQ and the Water Board must consider social and economic demographics during anti-degradation analysis of a high quality water under both Virginia law and the Clean Water Act, highlighting this legal requirement emphasizes the importance of this analysis to fair environmental decision-making. Thank you for considering my testimony. Jacqueline Goodrum "
Sims,Richmond,Appalachian Voices,2022,HB393,"On behalf of the organization Appalachian Voices, and our members across Virginia, including many of your constituents, I ask you to please support HB393. This water protection bill concerns review of social and economic demographics during anti-degradation analysis of high quality water. Consideration of those demographics would prevent disproportionate impacts to overburdened populations, including rural communities as permits to discharge are reviewed. Many of those same communities where projects can occur rely on the water resources located on their property for their livelihoods, from farming to raising livestock. Reviewing potential economic impacts should be an expressed requirement for projects which could impact the high quality water resources of a community.  Please support HB393.Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator, Appalachian Voices"
Sligh,Charlottesville,Wild Virginia,2022,HB393,"My name is David Sligh and I am a resident of Albemarle County. I am commenting in my capacity as Conservation Director for Wild Virginia and on behalf of our members across the state.This  amendment would simply ensure that the interests of local residents and communities are explicitly accounted for if the Water Board considers allowing lowering of water quality in a nearby waterbody . This is a matter of respecting the rights of people who sometimes have less power and influence, whether in rural or urban areas. Local waters are often of paramount importance to landowners and residents, for a variety of uses, property values, and peaceful enjoyment. Those values should be protected as much as possible. Under state law and the Clean Water Act the state is already required to assess whether  any decrease in quality for streams of high quality is an economic or social necessity for the area that would be affected. If not the degradation can't be allowed. That assessment must logically balance the values and costs for local people against those of all other interests. The language proposed in this bill would just expressly require that logical and fair treatment. Thank you for considering my testimony.David Sligh"
Vassey,Richmond,Virginia Manufacturers Association,2022,HB393,"Delegate Keam's HB704 (2020) established the Virginia Environmental Justice Act.  § 2.2-234. defines ""Environment"" as the natural, cultural, social, economic, and political assets or components of a community.  It defines ""Environmental justice"" as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of every person, regardless of race, color, national origin, income, faith, or disability, regarding the development, implementation, or enforcement of any environmental law, regulation, or policy. § 2.2-235 now states that it is the policy of the Commonwealth to promote environmental justice and ensure that it is carried out throughout the Commonwealth, with a focus on environmental justice communities and fenceline communities.HB393 is duplicative and redundant."

This bill is important for protecting rural communities, who are typically the first to be targeted for projects that could impact our water quality.

Jenkins,Goochland,Virginia Loggers Association,2022,HB297,"Virginia Loggers Association supports HB106, HB180, HB295, and HB 297. HB180 may help localities to retain forest lands in land use taxation programs.  Currently it appears many localities with forest land use taxation are considering its removal to meet operating costs.  The forest products industry is Virginia's third largest industry and depends the sustainable forest supply to daily supply the needs Virginia's mills.  This great industry is one we hope our elected policy makers will support with pro-business laws and supporting incentives for private landowners to maintain the forest land base.VLA also supports HB106, HB 295, and HB297 because they will help all businesses and especially those businesses struggling due to the pandemic, market declines, and causes beyond their control.

Kringer,Fairfax Station,Accotink Unitarian Universalist Church,2022,HB1261,"I strongly urge the committee to defeat HB 5, HB 1261, & HB 1301.   HB 1261 would repeal Virginia residents’ participation in important environmental decisions. Public input and public participation in environmental discussions are critical to raising issues of safety, health, social and economic impact, and whether the siting of a project is suitable for the location in which it is proposed.   HB 1301 will hinder Virginia's progress toward a clean economy by repealing Virginia's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Virginia's participation in RGGI is a successful effort to reduce pollution while directly helping communities on the front lines.   HB 5 diverts funding from the Community Flood Preparedness Fund (FUND) and creates a Flood Relief Fund. This is an inappropriate use of the RGGI funds. The existing FUND is already helping thousands of low-wealth families reduce energy bills and climate impacts, and localities deal with increasingly devastating floods.   As a person of conscience, it is essential to oppose bills like HB 5, HB 1261, & HB 1301, which will set Virginians backward in our goal to address the impacts of climate change and reach carbon-free energy by 2050."""
Remick-Simkins,Fairfax City,,2022,HB1261,"I oppose the passage of these bills.  We again, face a political opposition to taking care of our own and our environment in these bills.  I am particularly dismayed when those proposing these laws claim to be Christians.  In fact, passing these bills will ensure that we do the very opposite of what is a truly moral or Christian act.  It brings to mind the passage in Matthew 25:34-45.  Indeed if we claim that we have a moral authority of any kind - then we will not rescind our participation in the Greenhouse Gas Initiative, will not ensure that our environmental aspirations of caring for not only the Earth but those living in it then what can we truly say of ourselves as a state and a country?  I do not want to hear about the economic costs.  That is only a smokescreen to protect the proponents of this law from having to live with the consequences of passing these laws.  It really does come down to having a commitment to something far greater and more important than ourselves as individuals or our investments and bank accounts.  It is a matter of irreversible damage that cannot be undone once we have stepped over the place of no return.  Lastly,  if any claim pro-life - these laws destroy any credibility of those who stand by that position.   "

Wayland,Lancaster Co.,,2022,HB1261,"Supplemental Comments for full committee consideration:The comment was made in Subcommittee that Virginia is the only state in which a citizen Board makes permit decisions.  This is not true.  However, if its were true, that would not mean that the Commonwealth's approach is less desirable.  We are the only state in which a Governor cannot seek a second consecutive term.  Is this bad?  Some say yes, some say no.  It's just different.While opponents implied that any decision that deviated from DEQ's recommendation would be unscientific, the nature of changes to DEQ's recommendations are not about ""science.""  DEQ's rationale, including science, economics, practicality, etc. are almost always followed and are always considered.  DEQ is not infallible, however.  In every case during my 10+ years on the Water Board applicants were asked about whether they would be amenable to changes suggested  by a Board member and those responses were carefully considered by the Board.  This is part of the beauty of open decision-making. Proponents of the Bill did not give one specific example of a problem caused by a decision of the Water Board.  All arguments for the legislation were general, not specific.  It is reasonable to ask what problem the bill solves before deciding whether it has merit.The Board has had appointees from both parties, rural and urban areas, all geographic regions.  Member have had careers in industry, agriculture, law, science, and environmental policy.  This diversity of experience is another strength of Virginia's approach."

Kellam,Northampton County,,2022,HB1261,"I am writing in opposition to HB1261. I am a former member of the State Water Control Board; appointed by Governors Kaine and McAuliffe and also having served under Governor McDonnell. In my experience, Board members strive to be apolitical, uphold Virginia’s laws and regulations, and serve the public as well as the regulated community, all in the interest of the Commonwealth.  While day to day operations of DEQ are delegated to the Director, the Citizens boards provide the only opportunity for public hearings on environmental permits that impact the public’s surface water, ground water, wetlands, and air resources. Permit hearings and Board meetings provide the only peak behind the curtain; i.e., the only means of transparency and accountability for a governmental bureaucracy that has a significant impact on the lives of Virginia residents. While it has been extremely rare for a Citizen board to ever reject a recommendation by DEQ staff, it is not rare for Board members to suggest improvements to permit conditions that resolve contentious issues that impact neighbors or the public. I note that in the almost 9 years that I served on the SWCB, I never saw Delegate Bloxom attend any SWCB meeting so that he could see first hand  the important work of the citizen board in the permit review process . I urge this committee to reject this proposal as it would be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth in protecting the integrity, efficacy and public policy related to the relevant environmental permits."

The reforms will ensure that members picked by the Administration and legislature are qualified to serve and removes the Board’s ability to issue any environmental permit or abridge or deny any environmental permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality. Virginia is the only state in the US that gives this level of authority to bypass an environmental agency. Virginia is out of step with the nation, especially RGGI states. The reforms promote regulatory predictability and certainty and greatly curtail any political agendas - all necessary to maintain Virginia's competitiveness. "

Throp,Norfolk,,2022,HB1261,"I strongly oppose bill HB1261,  which would repeal permitting authority from the state environmental boards. These boards have relevant expertise in their subject areas and provide the public with opportunities to comment on pending decisions. It would be foolish to eliminate their important role in reviewing permit applications."
Wayland,White Stone,,2022,HB1261,"I served two terms on the Water Board, appointed by different Governors.  This bill seems to be a ""solution"" in search of a problem.  Decision-making by a non-partisan citizen board assures that the public is heard, can be present when a decision is made, and hears the basis for action by Board Members.  The Water Board usually adopts DEQ's recommendation, but sometimes that recommendation is changed through the discussion among the applicant, DEQ and the Board. Rarely the Board will make significant changes to permit terms or deny a permit. This public process builds understanding and acceptance of decisions.  Board members, who have a variety of perspectives and expertise, come from all areas of the Commonwealth.   Decision making by the Water Board does not add a significant amount of time to permit processing.  Many dischargers in the Commonwealth are covered by General Permits.  Individual permits for large volume dischargers are sometimes controversial and the fact that a Citizen Board considers the permit can add a degree of acceptance to the final decision that action by DEQ might not enjoy.  Since Board Members are not compensated, there is not significant cost savings to be realized by transferring permit responsibility to DEQ.  I hope to testify in person or virtually and would welcome any questions about my comments."

Wood,Richmond,,2022,HB645,"I write to express my support of HB 645. The recently published 6th Report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  is absolutely clear that we must do all we can to move away from the burning of fossil fuels and toward the development and utilization of renewable energy sources to ensure a livable future.  Divesting the Virginia Retirement system from fossil fuels constitutes a necessary step to accomplish this goal. I am a professor in the Religious Studies program at Virginia Commonwealth University. I teach courses on world religions, with a focus on their views about our obligations to care for the earth and for each other. They emphasize sound stewardship of nature just as VRS emphasizes sound stewardship of finances. In fact sound stewardship of nature is requisite for sound stewardship of finances. In addition to the loss of life, the financial costs of global warming linked disasters, including record-setting fires, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes, now runs in the hundreds of billions of dollars. See here  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/ Good stewardship of the earth and finances necessitates investing in development that repairs, protects, and preserves the health of the ecosystems on which our lives depend.

In 2021, the International Energy Agency said "" immediate action is needed to reshape the world’s energy sector in order to meet ambitious climate goals by 2050, including ending investments in new coal mines, oil and gas wells.""  Our remaining carbon budget could be fully expended just by burning fossil fuels already extracted and held in reserve, yet oil and gas companies continue exploring and extracting. This is a collective suicide, comparable to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. It is an ethical imperative to divest. "
Muth,Richmond,Th!rd Act Virginia,2022,HB645," I write on behalf of Th!rd Act Virginia, a State-wide group senior citizens who are strongly aligned with the divestment movement across the country, as well as a VRS retiree. We are very grateful to Delegate Kaye Kory for introducing HB645 which requires the Virginia Retirement System and local retirement systems to divest from fossil fuel companies by January 1, 2027. As everyone who respects science knows, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has set unambiguous targets for reducing climate emissions by 2030 and 2050. With these in mind, as well as the well being of our planet and out grandchildren and their grandchildren, I urge the GA to approve this bill and assure that the VRS divests from fossil fuel industries. Without actions precisely this one, we will not be able to achieve the IPCC goals and avoid the worst affects of climate warming.  In addition, fossil fuels are an increasingly poor financial risk and will continue to increase risk in the years ahead. On behalf of my group of highly active voters and our loved ones who are members of younger generations , I urge you to pass this bill. "
Williams,Richmond,"Sierra Club, Falls of the James Group",2022,HB645,"I am submitting comments today in support of Delegate Kaye Kory’s HB645 which requires the Virginia Retirement System and local retirement systems to divest from fossil fuel companies by January 1, 2027.With over $46 trillion in assets worldwide, pension funds are among the largest institutional investors in fossil fuels. These investments have dangerously underperformed the rest of the market, making public pensions’ fossil fuel investments risky for everyday people who are relying on these funds for their retirement.Divesting from fossil fuels will allow pensions to avoid major losses and gain the opportunity to reinvest in less risky sectors including climate solutions, local business and clean energy companies.Pension funds’ financial influence creates barriers to solutions to mitigate climate change, and there’s hard evidence that divestment, with reinvestment to assets aligned with environmentally-friendly business practices and the conservation of natural resources is a winning financial strategy.While profit is not the only motive, there is a decade of research evidencing that green investing beats the returns of more traditional assets.Thank you for your consideration of my remarks.

Mellos,"The Plains, Fauquier",,2022,HB645,"My family and I strongly support HB 630 and SB 747, which would allow speed cameras on Rte 17 between Marshall and Warrenton.This stretch of road is treacherous and deadly.We live at the intersection of Rte 17 and Old Tavern Rd (near Great Meadow).  We must merge from our gravel road onto Rte 17 or cross Rte 17 every time we leave the house.  The large volume of high speed traffic makes this a potentially deadly maneuver every day.My father was killed when he attempted to cross Rte 17 to have dinner with us.  His car was T-boned, and flipped several times.  He was airlifted by medivac helicopter to Fairfax Hospital, where he passed away after a week suffering in trauma intensive care.  Our family is still devastated.It is difficult to  appreciate how treacherous this stretch of road is unless you have daily experienced trying to merge with double-trailer tractor trailers and other vehicles that often  travel in excess of 70 mph, and appear from just around the bend when you have little time to get up to speed.When we hear a helicopter in the distance, we tense up, and watch to see if it is a medivac chopper landing on Rte 17 to evacuate yet more accident victims.  Several times, it has been.  Several more times we have heard crashes from our house a mile away, and my sons ran over to make sure it was not their sister coming home from school.I have counted at least 5 deaths at that single intersection since about 2015.   That is more than all the homicides in Fauquier County.Rte 17 is different than most roads.  It is treacherous because it has two conflicting characters: it is a local rural road with numerous driveways and small roads intersecting on both sides.  Large horse trailers merge on and off, and school buses stop to pick up and drop off children.   It’s second character is effectively a major interstate highway, functioning similarly to I-95.   (It is a thoroughfare for truckers and others to quickly access the inland port).  It could be made less treacherous by consistent and thorough enforcement of reasonable speed limits via speed cameras.Rte 17 simply must be made safer.  It is unconscionable to allow this level of death and injury to continue.  I am generally opposed to speed cameras, having experienced seemingly unnecessary cameras in DC that, in my opinion, may have impeded rather than improved safe traffic flow.  However, in this case, it is essential to reduce speed to improve safety on this deadly stretch of road, and speed cameras are the only consistently effective way to reduce speed and save lives on Rte 17.  I respect and admire the difficult work that truckers do and appreciate their essential role in a healthy economy.  I believe that these bills benefit truckers as well as the local residents that share Rte 17.    Truckers may not be aware of the many driveways and roads that intersect Rte 17.    I don’t think that even a very capable, experienced truck driver would necessarily expect a high volume of  slower-moving local traffic on a road that effectively functions as an interstate.  I think it’s an unusual  and unexpected combination of uses, and therefore, speed cameras would help truckers to be safer, which is one of their main priorities.Please enact these bills so that we can reduce deaths and injuries on this treacherous stretch of roadway."
Kreydatus,Henrico,,2022,HB645,"I am writing to support HB 645, a bill that would divest the Virginia Retirement system from fossil fuels. I’ve worked as a state employee for Virginia Commonwealth University since 2007; I’m a university professor who has taught at three Virginia public universities. It’s ironic that our retirement system was established to ensure that public workers like myself can enjoy a measure of financial stability and wellness after years of service to the state. The mission of the VRS refers to “sound financial stewardship,” a goal that we all appreciate as we work to prepare to reach a period in our life when we can, or sometimes must, step away from paid employment. However, as an employee who is anticipating probably another 3 decades in the workforce, I struggle to imagine financial stability and wellness for my own retirement, despite a life of full-time, hard work. Trusted world scientists who compiled the IPCC reports have clearly explained to us that we have less than a decade to end our dependence on fossil fuels; if we fail to do so, we will face massive crop failures, geo-political instability, extreme storms, rapid sea level rise, and a long list of other catastrophies. That’s not a retirement I want to invest in. I believe it is the responsibility of the Virginia General Assembly to ensure that the employees who serve our state in roles like mine have access to public benefits that match our values. I shouldn’t be forced to choose between my values and my retirement, and Virginia shouldn’t require our workforce to invest in companies that are so contrary to our public interests and our liveable future. Please support this disinvestment bill, thank you for your time."
Sims,Henrico,,2022,HB645,"My name is Jessica Sims and I submit this comment as a private citizen, deeply concerned with the continued investment that our state-funded and related agencies retain in industries directly harmful to Virginia constituents. I ask you to please support HB 645. Through volunteering with organizations such as DivestRVA and InvestVA, I’ve had the pleasure of learning about the crucial step of divesting from companies and financial institutions which perpetuate and support extractive, harmful industries.  This timely step helps move communities closer to an equitable, clean energy future as profit is no longer associated with the fossil fuel industry, which actively harms people, places, livelihoods and ecosystems.   Within the fiscal impact statement divestment is characterized as a ""last resort,"" but for VA-run fiduciary entities to best serve those they provide funds for, they should consider this an ""only resort"" and should please consider and calculate, the cost of not divesting. What negative health impacts tied to the oil, gas, coal and petroleum industries would be supported through continued financial partnership? Delegate Kory has put forth important legislation which recognizes the severity of the current climate crisis, and reflects the urgency of the timeline we need to move forward in a way which best serves communities.

Kushner,Nelson County,Third Act,2022,HB645,"My pension comes from the VRS so I have tried to educate myself about investments the VRS holds. I congratulate the VRS on its success at generating healthy returns. But fossil fuel investments have turned a corner and no longer generate the returns they did even a few years ago. Pipelines and oil & gas infrastructure are getting fierce resistance and getting canceled at ever-increasing rates as our climate emergency has become not just a concern, but a most pressing global crisis of our time. In our state alone, we’ve seen the Atlantic Coast Pipeline canceled in 2020, due to community resistance. The Mountain Valley Pipeline, now 2 years behind schedule and $3 billion over budget, was denied an air permit for its Lambert compressor station in November. This past Tuesday the MVP was dealt what may have been its death sentence by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals denied for the second time the MVP’s crossing of the Jefferson National Forest. MVP’s main investor, EQT (EquitransMid) saw its stock plunge more than 20% yesterday. This story is being repeated ever more frequently, and that’s a very good thing for our local communities, resources and planet.The divestment movement is catching fire, so to speak. Pension funds in MA, NY, ME, RI and PA have already divested or are working towards it. States, communities, colleges and universities are divesting. Pressure is mounting for banks and financial institutions to divest. Already, more than 40 trillion $ has been committed to divestment from FF globally. Renewables are the hot and necessary trend now, here and in developing markets. I caution the Board to scrutinize new investments for the greenwashing that’s become prevalent. Not every fund with the word ‘green’ or ‘bio’ in it is a good thing. The public is not going to back down on this issue, and will only increase demands as our small window of opportunity to prevent the most catastrophic consequences of inaction closes. The divestment movement is not going away."

[RPS-George Wythe High School] needs this additional revenue to build new schools and modernize facilities to improve the learning experience of its students. According to the Virginia Department of Education, more than half of the state’s school buildings are more than 50 years old. Unfortunately, my community is home to several of these outdated buildings including George Wythe High School. Students and teachers are placed in unsafe environments that may have leaky roofs, windowless classrooms, mold, poor ventilation, and broken HVAC systems. It is not helpful to the learning environment and development of children to attend school in buildings that harm their health and well-being. Having the sales tax as an option will give us the opportunity to fix the crumbling schools in my school district. I am afraid that if the General Assembly doesn’t pass this bill, another generation of students will be forced to sit in outdated, 50-year old classrooms that are inadequate for what students need today.Please prioritize education and the future of our commonwealth by taking this necessary step to invest in our schools, our students, and our community.Thank you so much for listening and remember #WytheCantWait #AllRPSCantWait #WeAreRPS"

Leyen,Richmond,Virginia League of Conservation Voters,2022,HB892,"The Virginia League of Conservation Voters Opposes this legislation for the following reasons:SB398/HB892 would give more than 7 million severely discounted allowances to a private sophisticated company—LS Power—which has raised over $47 billion in financing since 1990.The proposal calls for a set price of $2, as compared to the most recent auction price of $13.  In 2020, the General Assembly already considered this issue and rejected multiple attempts by LS Power to obtain free or heavily discounted allowances. Nothing has changed and the General Assembly should reject this request too.Instead of letting the market cost of allowances drive power plant decisions to reduce emissions over time, these bills would do the opposite—rigging the market price of an allowance for a single company. This proposal would take away tens of millions of dollars from low-wealth families trying to reduce their electricity bills and localities trying to address recurrent flooding, for the benefit of a private sophisticated company.These bills could actually let LS Power profit—it could sell already-acquired allowances at market rates and then turn around and purchase $2 allowances for compliance purposes in 2021 and 2022."

Ryan,McLean,,2022,HB1346,Please support HB1346 so that localities throughout Virginia have the authority to require the replacement and planting of trees during the development process. The destruction of trees by developers greatly affects the health and quality of life for humans and animals. Preservation of mature trees is vital for climate resilience. We also need to ensure that tree replacements are native species for maximum benefit to our ecosystem. 
Leyen,Richmond,Virginia League of Conservation Voters,2022,HB1346,"The Virginia League of Conservation Voters supports HB520 and HB1346.Reasons to SUPPORT HB 520:- HB520 encourages localities to adopt resilience strategies within their comprehensive plans including strategies to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to changing conditions and hazardous events.- Although current provisions in the Virginia Code currently require some Tidewater localities to include guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to foster the sustainability of shoreline resources; and for Hampton Roads Planning District Commission localities to incorporate strategies to combat sea level rise and recurrent flooding, all localities within Virginia are being impacted by stronger storms and subsequent flood events.- HB 520 is one of a suite of bills proposed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission intended to integrate statewide flooding and resilience planning and implementation across the Commonwealth in a comprehensive manner.Reasons to SUPPORT HB 1346:50,000 acres of forest and non-urban tree canopy are converted to other land uses per year in Virginia due to timber harvest, urbanization, agricultural expansion, and other drivers.These bills are the result of the months’ long stakeholder advisory group representing local government, home builders, commercial builders, agriculture, conservation members and Department of Forestry.The legislation prioritizes on-site tree preservation and replanting but affords some opportunities to meet canopy requirements in nearby under-resourced communities—including formerly redlined neighborhoods—to help offset urban heat islands. The bills also allow larger tree canopies to be required when development occurs in areas with existing enhanced tree canopies or when a locality agrees to a somewhat reduced local parking lot, setbacks, and similar requirements."

This Code section prohibits localities from creating ordinances and regulations that limit or restrict legitimate silvicultural activities i.e. forest harvesting and other best management forestry practices necessary for healthy forest stands.Development is a process which can best be determined by professional staff of localities, project managers, and development staff with skills in forestry, water quality protection, and other environmental issues.  This is best determined on a case by case basis.  General specifications regarding tree canopy, tree replacement, and similar matters are not the answer.§ 10.1-1126.1. Silvicultural practices; local government authority limited.A. Forestry, when practiced in accordance with accepted silvicultural best management practices as determined by the State Forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105, constitutes a beneficial and desirable use of the Commonwealth's forest resources.B.

Local ordinances and regulations shall not require a permit or impose a fee for such silvicultural activity. Local ordinances and regulations pertaining to such silvicultural activity shall be reasonable and necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens residing in the locality, and shall not be in conflict with the purposes of promoting the growth, continuation and beneficial use of the Commonwealth's privately owned forest resources.

Citizens have a right to a clean and healthy environment and should be able to determine how best to preserve trees in their locality. The lack of ANY effort currently is appalling. "
Jones,"Lake Barcroft, Fairfax County",,2022,HB1346,"Please support this bill requiring developers to replace trees taken down during building on new or existing lots.  Tree loss is a scourge that has long lasting impact locally on neighborhoods and cumulatively on our planet.  Reducing the tree canopy in an edge forest or existing pocket forest as in common in our urban landscape, weakens the wind break shelter for other trees in the immediate area; making them prone to blow down if they are already weakened by disease, excessive impermeable surfaces nearby, or overzealous pruning.  Mature native trees like Oak, Willow, Cherry, Tulip Poplar, Beech, Holly--the list goes on and on, provide ecosystem resources--food for fledgling birds, in the form of caterpillars that grown on the trees from deposited moth eggs.  The trees act as heat sinks, cooling areas in summer through transpiration.  The trees reduce  water run off and help filter ground water first through their umbrella leave canopy all the way down to their extensive root system.  The trees use carbon from the atmosphere and build their tissue this way, thereby sucking up our own carbon dioxide pollution and turn it into carbon--wood, and sugar-leaves.  Please pass this bill and look to ways to incentivize for builders to leave mature trees on their lots during development.   To build more background knowledge, if anyone is interested, please read any of these books by Dr. Doug Tallamy, Bringing Nature Home, Nature's Best Hope or The Nature of Oaks.  Respectfully submitted.  Thank you for your time."
Brookes-Weiss,Falls Church,,2022,HB1346,"Our city, state, earth, needs every bit of help it can get!  We have massive developments, where builders and developers are just allowed to slaughter and clear cut beautiful old trees.  It’s horrific.  For example, Brooks place development on sleepy hollow in falls church, slaughtered ten acres of trees!   How can that happen or be permitted?  Can’t they make lots and all have to have trees around them?  Every slaughtered oak hosts over 400 species of moth and butterfly’s.   That’s before you talk the birds they support and the flying squirrels.  Then they provide the leaf litter that supports thousand more critters - mammals, skinks, salamanders, toads, box turtles and all the birds that feed off those small rodent mammals and all those eggs amongst the leaf litter.  Removing a single tree impacts hundreds of wildlife.  This is before we even discuss the value of trees in reducing carbon and protecting earth from water runoff.  Tree value goes on and on.  I would challenge everyone on the committee to read The Nature of Oaks by Doug Tallamy and then not see the need to replace every tree that is removed.   I support tree replacement.  Every removed tree should be required to be replaced with a native tree - whether it’s an over story tree or understory tree.  Let’s not repeat the  Bradford Pear tree disaster.  Replace trees. Replace them with native trees.  Thank you. "
Garland,Fairfax County,Friends of Accotink Creek www.accotink.org,2022,HB1346,"Friends of Accotink Creek SUPPORTS Del.  Bulova's HB1346 regarding tree canopy.  Due to increased development, many areas in Virginia are losing trees to impervious surfaces.   More impervious surfaces means more stormwater runoff.  One inch of rainfall on an acre of parking produces 27,000 gallons of stormwater. (Source: Penn State Extension). Stormwater runoff is the number one cause of stream erosion in urban and suburban areas. Restoring eroded streams is costly for Virginia taxpayers: The Town of Vienna's 2nd phase of the Bear Branch stream-restoration project along 2,300 feet of Bear Branch comes to $2.52 million. Fairfax County will pay one half, the state of Virginia the other. That amounts to $1,096 per foot. And that's just one project! Stormwater runoff also silts up lakes. Dredging lakes, to retain their value as recreational amenities, is extremely costly. Lake Accotink in Fairfax County has a sediment load of some 500 cubic yards and requires a dredging project estimated at $60 million. The work will begin in 2023. If stormwater is not reduced, the lake will need future dredgings.  Stormwater runoff also pollutes our waterways. As it pounds down on paved surfaces, stormwater picks up trash, oil and grease, pet waste, pesticides, lawn fertilizer, road salt, and metals, and carries them into streams.  An important function of trees is to absorb stormwater falling on impervious surfaces. A single mature, deciduous tree intercepts from 500 to 700 gallons of water from rainfall each year. Lawns absorb very little. Delegates of the CC&T Committee, we urge you not to cave to the demands of special interest groups, and allow communities in Virginia burdened with the costs of excessive stormwater to manage their own solutions. Please support HB 1346/ SB537."
Vinograd-Bausell,Fairfax County,,2022,HB1346,"Please support HB1346 so that localities have the power to require the replacement and planting of trees during the development process.

Frequently it's also unnecessary, serving only to lower costs for the developer.  If developers knew they would have to replace trees, maybe they would reconsider antiquated clear-cutting practices.  Please support this bill and let local governments decide about this important issue."

We fear such restriction might be construed to give localities additional authority to dictate, restrict, or prohibit legitimate silvicultural activities.  We also know of situations where legitimate forest harvesters are perceived to be part of the development and localities have tried to hold them responsible for erosion & sediment regulations.Forest harvesting is often the first land disturbance activity to occur in development.  Legitimate silviculture is exempt from erosion & sediment rules although subject to the silvicultural water quality law in 10.1-1181.2.Forest harvesters can inadvertently become involved as part of the development when in fact they are secured only to perform the silvicultural forest harvesting. This incorrect interpretation can result in problems for the innocent.Localities have access to many experts who can help development project leaders determine best practices for water quality, shade, aesthetics, and control of erosion and sediment movement.  VLA contends it is difficult to arbitrarily set canopy tree cover standards when it should be based on the professional judgements of skilled practitioners.VLA hopes this may help you to understand the concerns of our members and business owners.

Garland,Fairfax County,,2022,HB1346," I SUPPORT Delegate Bulova's HB1346.   The Dept. of Forestry says that Virginia loses 16,000 acres of trees every year to development and disease.  We need to be planting a lot more to stem this loss. Communities need the authority to protect their tree canopies from rapacious developers who clear cut lots for their own convenience, and do not trouble to replant them. The house next door to us had 15 to 20 mature trees. Now it has only the 2  small ones planted by the builders.  Trees are valuable not only for the ecological services they provide, but for their beauty.  Please prioritize the needs of communities over the profits of developers."
Bean,Arlington,,2022,HB1346,"Please support HB1346, a bill that should enjoy bipartisan support.  Virginia's tree canopy is suffering, and local communities want to help.  Mature trees preserve water, soil, and carbon, purify the air, provide shade during increasingly long hot summers, and increase residential and commercial property values.  Developers nevertheless often cut down mature trees using the misguided reasoning that buyers prefer clear-cut lots and preserving trees isn't worth the effort.  When construction is done, developers typically plant a few immature trees which may not even live one year. Please give local governments the authority to evaluate individual lots and projects, and preserve mature trees where appropriate.  Lawmakers in Richmond don't have the time, skills, or expertise to displace local officials dedicated to beautifying their communities and ensuring good property values through trees.   Thank you."

Stillman,VIENNA,Taxpaying Citizen,2022,HB471,I've worked for the last 6 years as a citizen advocate in Fairfax County to get solar on school roofs.  Students came to me and asked for help in this advocacy.  We're finally seeing this come about and it will save the school system money.  The utility continues to raise the price of electricity and FCPSchools will have a $1.5M short fall in FY2023 which could have been avoided with the massive deployment of solar as the price is locked in for the term of the agreement.Students care about the future and the reduction of CO2 from the generation of electricity.  Making schools designed for net zero in Fairfax County will only add 5% to the construction cost and will be recouped in 10 years according to a study that the school system contracted.  The air quality will be better for these students contributing to their health and the learning environment is improved.  Building schools to net zero and solar ready makes good economic sense.  Please vote in favor of HB471.
Nawaz,McLean,Virginia Grassroots Coalition,2022,HB471,"Thank you for the opportunity to voice my support for HB471. This bill makes sense because it prepares our buildings for the future. Schools that produce as much energy as they consume are healthier for students, leading to fewer student absences and higher academic achievement.They are also good for taxpayers. The costs of making a building net-zero (which starts with energy efficiency) and solar-ready is minimal.A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to energy-positive standards recover the added construction costs in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years."
Kent,Great Falls,,2022,HB471,"I am writing as a taxpaying Virginian who believes that funds allocated for education should be expended, as much as possible, on educating students rather than paying for inefficient and costly operations such as energy consumption for heating and cooling.  It's pretty simple: spend less on energy and more on education.  I also believe that it is best to be take actions that leave open opportunties for future major gains. Passing HB 471 achieves both of these objectives.  By implementing some fairly basic design requirements, newly constructed public buildings will be positioned to achieve major cost savings over a period of time much shorter than the expected life span of the building.  The same is true for major modifications of those buildings as defined in this bill.  But to maximize these benefits, the building must be ready.   A number of studies have shown this.  For example, a November 2020  study by Perkins Eastman, an international architecure design & consulting firm makes this exact point.  For example, on page 28:  ""PV (solar array panels) is MOST affordable when installed on a building’s roof. PV which must be mounted separately from the building on parking lot awnings and the like is much more expensive, as the project must pay for an additional structure as well as the additional infrastructure to route power from these remote locations into the building power grid. Therefore, the design and massing of the building, as well as the location of HVAC equipment within the building rather than on the building’s roof, is critical to maximize the roof area available for building PV. Roofs that are held to a consistent elevation and kept free of all HVAC equipment (which is located within the building) give the best mounting surface for any required PV arrays.""Clearly, if you do not pass this bill, you will be wasting taxpayer money on expenditures that could have been easily avoided.  Therefore, I urge you to recommend reporting this bill.Thank you,Robin S. KentGreat Falls, VA"
Pien,Leesburg,Loudoun Climate Project,2022,HB471,"Hello.  My name is Natalie Pien from Leesburg, VA representing Loudoun Climate Project to speak in support HB471 Solar Ready Roofs.  Since the 2013 General Assembly authorization for Power Purchase Agreements, more than 45 school districts throughout VA have entered in solar PPAs.   Schools with solar panels are •	healthier for students inside with fewer absences due to illness, •	better for Virginia’s air quality as greenhouse gas emissions are not emitted•	taking urgently needed steps to mitigate climate change.While current law requires new public buildings & those undergoing major renovations to meet high energy performance standards, rooftop solar-readiness is not included.  This bill not only adds rooftop solar-readiness, it specifies design and construction to net-zero energy standards in accordance with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers for K-12 schools.

Pender,Hampton,Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB471,"Solar power energy is used substantially for public facilities across the United States of America. Cities like Santa Fe, New Mexico have installed enough renewable energy on city facilities to provide 25% of its electricity needs, including 4.6MW of solar energy.  HB471 can ensure that Virginia can have solar-ready roofs becoming part of the planning process for new public buildings and those undergoing major renovation. Solar-ready roofs save money for taxpayers by allowing public buildings to install solar at no upfront cost, and with long-term savings.  In fact, this bill will ensure that public schools be designed and constructed to produce as much energy as they consume and become built to net-zero energy standards. Thus, for these reasons CCAN supports this bill HB471."
Lee,Fairfax County,Oakton High School Environmental Club,2022,HB471,"We are a group of students from Oakton High School Environmental Club, and we wanted to express our support for HB 471, which requires that renovated schools and public buildings be made ready for solar energy. As high schoolers, the transition to clean energy is especially important to our futures. As our high school has undergone its new renovation, we urge not only our school, but other Virginia schools to do their part to make this world more sustainable. Through this bill we are stepping closer to a more green future as the energy consumed is less than is being generated. Solar panels added will not only provide electricity for the school, it will also provide more electricity than is used, creating a net financial gain for schools. A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to net-zero standards recover the added construction cost in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years.Sincerely, Carolyn Hindle, District 35, 9661 Masterworks Drive, Vienna, VA, 22181 (Rep.

Tisha Erby,Richmond City,RPS,2022,HB1185,"Hello I’m Tisha Erby Mother of 5 boys , 4 are Richmond Public School Students and WE support HB 531 which will allow all counties and cities to use a 1% sales tax to pay for the construction of new schools. [RPS-George Wythe High School] needs this additional revenue to build new schools and modernize facilities to improve the learning experience of its students. According to the Virginia Department of Education, more than half of the state’s school buildings are more than 50 years old. Unfortunately, my community is home to several of these outdated buildings including George Wythe High School. Students and teachers are placed in unsafe environments that may have leaky roofs, windowless classrooms, mold, poor ventilation, and broken HVAC systems. It is not helpful to the learning environment and development of children to attend school in buildings that harm their health and well-being. Having the sales tax as an option will give us the opportunity to fix the crumbling schools in my school district. I am afraid that if the General Assembly doesn’t pass this bill, another generation of students will be forced to sit in outdated, 50-year old classrooms that are inadequate for what students need today.Please prioritize education and the future of our commonwealth by taking this necessary step to invest in our schools, our students, and our community.Thank you so much for listening and remember #WytheCantWait #AllRPSCantWait #WeAreRPS"
LeMenestrel,McLean,,2022,HB558,"We urge the Committee to OPPOSE HB558 (O'Quinn -R) – related to Biogas.While there is no question that methane released by feedstock is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, the solution proposed in this bill is NOT the right solution – or at very minimum more research and more guarantees in the bill would be needed to ensure that this would in fact result in methane reduction.   As it stands, the bill provides NO ASSURANCE that it will result in methane reduction and its implementation would be extremely detrimental both to the environment/climate and to Virginia taxpayers.    This bill is STRONGLY opposed by all the major environmental organizations including: Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, NRDC, Nature Conservancy, Va League of Conservation Voters, Virginia Conservation Network             Reasons to Oppose and Explanations: 1. The bills allow concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) as locations where methane could be captured and inserted into pipelines as gas. This would allow gas companies to propose connector pipelines to reach site(s) closest to their existing lines. Since the CAFO could profit from the purchase of the gas, the bill incentivizes the production of methane at these sites and further incentivises CAFOs already horrendous management practices. There exists a profit motive, and both the gas company and the CAFO facility want nothing more. The waste lagoons associated with CAFOs are doing significant damage; both to the environment through leaching of the unlined ponds and to the communities in which they are located, which are almost always environmental justice communities. Environmental justice communities would be subjected to the continued purposeful development of methane for the purpose of feeding a gas industry pipeline(s). 2. The bills contain no required environmental benefit associated with the allowance of new gas infrastructure. The bill would allow the gas industry to propose connector lines to CAFOs, wastewater treatment sites, and landfills, construct them, and not even have to guarantee that methane emissions at the site will be reduced or that the overall project will reduce methane. Gas companies get to build & prove nothing. 3. The bills contain little to no consumer protections for the ratepayer of the gas companies. The gas industry is highjacking “emissions reductions” as the sole justification for tens of millions in increased ratepayer costs but refusing to prove in any way that the emissions went down due to the investment. It's greenwashing at its finest. The ratepayer is on the hook for the construction and maintenance, and they don’t even get cleaner air. For more details, see for example this position paper:  https://www.ncconservationnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/biogaspositionpaperNC33021.pdf"
Pender,Hampton, Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB558,"Methane is a fatal greenhouse gas emitted by human activities like raising livestock.  Bill HB558 will allow concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to act as locations where methane could be captured and inserted into pipelines as gas.  CAFO facilities are nortrious to producing waste lagoons that harm the environment through leaching of the unlined ponds and to the communities in which they are located.  HB558 will guarantee gas industries to propose connector lines to CAFOs, wastewater treatment sites, and landfills. CAFOs will profit on such projects that would most likely result in unnecessary productions of methane gas. By allowing this bill to pass,  you will be undermining not only the environment of Virginia, but also consumer protections for the ratepayer of the gas companies as well by increasing the production of waste energy.  This bill will cause dire consequences to the Commonwealth of Virginia and that is why CCAN Action Fund opposes VA HB558."
Steinhilber,Virginia Beach,Environmental Defense Fund,2022,HB364,"Environmental Defense Fund strongly supports both HB 520 and HB 364.  HB 520 encourages localities to adopt resilience strategies within their comprehensive plans including strategies to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to changing conditions and hazardous events. Although current provisions in the Virginia Code currently require some Tidewater localities to include guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to foster the sustainability of shoreline resources; and for Hampton Roads Planning District Commission localities to incorporate strategies to combat sea level rise and recurrent flooding, all localities within Virginia are being impacted by stronger storms and subsequent flood events. Therefore, HB520 proposes that all localities should include resilience strategies in their comprehensive plans.  Similarly, Environmental Defense Fund supports HB 364, which adds climate resilience as a subject to be included in regional plans created by planning district commissions. Assessing climate vulnerabilities and opportunities for resilience as a key initial step to developing long-term adaptation strategies that will allow Virginian communities and businesses to thrive in the midst of climate impacts."
Patwardhan,Fairfax County,,2022,HB364,"I support HB 364, 520, and 1276 and would like to add that LAND USE must be part of our conception of ""climate resiliency"". Transportation and poor land use account for a lot of climate change, and no serious climate plan can skip over addressing car dependence, sprawl, car culture, lawn culture, and single-use zoning. All this applies to our conception of a ""healthy community"" too. When more people walk, bike, and take transit to get around, we get healthier communities. Car culture is terrible for public health.I support HB 1346 and would like to add that there needs to be significant emphasis on NATIVE trees and efforts to root out non-native trees, many of which are actively invasive and ecologically harmful.I SUPPORT HB 548."
Alderman,"Crozet, VA",,2022,HB1054,"I strongly favor HB1054 and encourage you to pass it. It protects vulnerable Virginians from freezing or sweltering to death under extreme conditions, and makes it easier for them to pay reconnection or disconnection fees. People can't be productive, hard-working, taxpaying citizens if they're sick or dead. As legislators, you have a responsibility to protect Virginians from harm whenever and wherever you can. Please pass HB1054.I also strongly favor HB600. As we've seen in the pandemic, people can't always control when, why, or how they find themselves unemployed. And when they're suddenly thrown out of work, I feel that giving them a lifeline to help them get back on their feet is money well spent for all of us. And I strongly advocate for HB447. Elected officials make a lot of noise about broadband access for Virginians, but rarely do anything about it. In exchange for their monopoly control over large swaths of the state, broadband providers need to serve the public interest by offering affordable plans."
Rojas,Falls Church,Self,2022,HB1054,"Thank you to the Chair for allowing me this opportunity. My name is Claudia and I am speaking as a concerned resident of Falls Church. I am expressing my support for HB 1054. I live and volunteer with working-class families in a community that neighbors the middle class Lake Barcroft community. The families I know are worried about affording next month’s rent, and this bill would mean that families are not forced to live without utilities due to non-payment during times of crisis. Access to utilities creates healthy home environments and helps prevent the spread of colds, the flu, and COVID. We can’t control weather, but we can expand access to water, gas, and electricity during extreme conditions. This will strengthen the health of VA’s neighborhoods. Finally, with this testimony, I ask the subcommittee to support HB 1054."
Jones,Richmond,VA Interfaith Power & Light,2022,HB1054,Some of our neighbors most impacted and financially burdened by utility bills and times of emergency are those in low-income families and communities of color. HB 1054 expands protections for families financially burdened by utility bills in times of crisis. 
Gebre,Richmond,Virginia Interfaith Power & Light,2022,HB1054,"My name is Kidest Gebre and I am the Organizing Coordinator and Communicating Our Power Fellow for Virginia Interfaith Power & Light, we collaborate among people of faith and conscience to grow healthy communities by advancing climate and environmental justice. We urge you to support HB 1054. This legislation is important to many of our faith communities. Many faith communities in Virginia offer social services to help pay bills like food, rent, and utility bills (water, electricity, and gas) for families in need and offer life-saving support. As people of faith, this past Sunday, over 75 faith communities and households in Virginia stood in solidarity with the many vulnerable Virginians who are living in danger of utility disconnections this winter.We’ve had faith leaders, express that the members of their congregation “who live paycheck to paycheck lose their power due to late payments. That means their food spoils in the fridge and their kids can’t access the internet for school. Utilities are too vital for people who are already living on the edge to lose.”  This bill gives folks the extra time and the proper time of delay from disconnections during times of public health emergency and extreme weather.  Thank you!"
Turner,Richmond,Virginia Conservation Network,2022,HB1054,"Dear Members of the House Commerce and Energy - Subcommittee #3, on behalf of the Virginia Conservation Network I urge you to vote ""no"" on HB894 and HB1326, and to vote ""yes"" on HB1054. For your convince I am attaching  combined talking points on each bill."
Gebre,Richmond,Virginia Interfaith Power & Light,2022,HB1054,"As the impacts of climate change worsen, extreme weather events are predicted to be more frequent and severe, likely affecting our most vulnerable neighbors. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that just last year deadly weather such as flooding events, extreme heat, tornadoes, and cyclones cost $145 billion, the third-highest cost on record, and killed more than 600 people. "
Pender,Hampton,Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB1054,"Virginia’s climate is rapidly changing. The United States Environmental Protection Agency explains how Virginia’s sea level has risen from one to two inches every decade.  With Higher water levels, Virginia residents are experiencing extreme weather conditions like eroding beaches, submerging lowlands, and exacerbating coastal flooding. Bill HB1054 is essential because it  provides protections for our neighbors at higher risk of being affected by extreme weather events, ensures life-saving access to those who need gas, electric, and water services the most, and bans utilities from charging households for disconnecting and reconnecting their accounts.  Hence, CCAN Action Fund supports this bill HB1054."

Pender,Hampton , Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB1326,"The continuous debate on whether waste coal can be reused as a sustainable source of electricity is not only a fallacious belief, but also a hazardous option for electricity generation.  Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Coal contains trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive elements. The process of burning coal at coal-fired power plants, called combustion, creates wastes that contain small amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive material (NORM).  If such waste is reused to produce electricity that is utilized in areas with high volume, people can become exposed to these radioactive elements.  This bill will undermine previous climate and clean energy adoption bills Virginia has committed to.Thus, CCAN Action Fund opposes HB1326."

Give them a voice to determine what  is in the best interest for their profession. Teachers work day and night to provide what is in the best interest of students- no one knows better then they do how to achieve this- they deserve a voice in the decision-making  We will lose the best  teachers, firefighters and policemen if we take away this critical opportunity for them to have a voice  in their professions.

Blose,Pulaski,Select...,2022,HB903,We know what are students need more than anyone.     I work out Special Education students every day.  They always asking why do we have to do this or that.

Sullivan,Ashburn,Loudoun Education Association,2022,HB903,"These bills will repeal educators' progress toward gaining collective bargaining. They will silence educators' voices. School decisions will not be able to capitalize on the experiences and skills of their experts in their school systems, the educators. Why deny educators a seat at the table? Why squelch expert input? Educators are the experts in our schools. Bargaining with educators benefits our students' learning conditions. It improves educator working conditions, and ultimately benefits our Virginia communities.Bring the experts to the table. I urge you to vote no on these bills.Sincerely,"

Morrissey,"Sterling, Loudoun County",Money Out Virginia/American Promise,2022,HB71,"Our team from Money Out Virginia, the VA affiliate of the nation-wide American Promise campaign finance reform advocacy organization, worked hard this past year with the ""Joint Subcommittee to Study Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform,"" and produced a ""Citizens' Report"" for  the Subcommittee that articulated principles and priorities for improving transparency,  preventing corrupt campaign finance practices and moving towards more equity in campaign financing in Virginia elections.  The partnership between the Subcommittee and Money Out Virginia has resulted in a series of important bills that improve the requirements, process and electronic infrastructure for disclosure of campaign donations.  We strongly support Delegate Bulova's HB 492, HB495, and HB500,  Delegate Helmer's HB489,  Delegate Anderson's HB86 and Delegate Davis' HB125, which provides for penalties for violations of disclosure laws.  We also support Delegate Bulova's HJ53 to extend the mandate of the Joint Subcommittee so that we can continue our partnership in developing sensible campaign finance reforms for Virginia. "
Morgan,Alexandria,VA Chapter of American Promise,2022,HB71,"I'm the coordinator of the VA Chapter of American Promise. Ideally, we wouldn't need to pass this type of legislation because VA, like 22 other states and the federal government, should ban corporate contributions so this wouldn't be needed. In the absence, however,  of any limitations bill which levels the playing field for donors, our group generally supports this bill.  Clearly contributions from state-regulated monopolies to legislators who vote on bills influencing these entities is perceived by the public as a  conflict of interest.   At least 5 states specifically prohibit public utility companies from making contributions to candidates for public utility commissions, including Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, & Oklahoma.  So there is precedent in applying this type of rule to public utilities in Virginia.  "
Stephen Spitz,Falls Church in Fairfax County,,2022,HB71,"Virginia is one of only five states that has no limits on the amount of money any individual, corporation, or other entity can contribute to candidates for public office.

The public strongly supports campaign finance reform. Please take this issue seriously this session.I strongly support HB 973, HB 71, and HB 575. There is an inherent conflict of interest for State regulated monopoly public utilities to make contributions, let alone unlimited contributions, to those who are responsible for regulating them. There is a strong public perception of corruption in Virginia when there are no limitations whatsoever on how much money can be donated to candidates nor any restrictions on how such money can be spent. My own State Senator brags that he is the largest recipient of money from one of the public utilities and also openly states that he launders money from that utility to give to other candidates.  That does not give me or my neighbors confidence that he is representing out concerns  rather than his funders. The Virginia Way of pay-to-play must end if we are truly going to be a democracy. The proposed campaign finance limits should be reduced to match the limits for Federal candidates. I believe it is reasonable for there to be a child care exception to the ban on personal use of campaign funds. Public confidence in elections and elected officials will only increase if the public does not have the perception that their elected officials are “bought” by special interests.

Kringer,Fairfax Station,Accotink Unitarian Universalist Church,2022,HB1301,"I strongly urge the committee to defeat HB 5, HB 1261, & HB 1301.   HB 1261 would repeal Virginia residents’ participation in important environmental decisions. Public input and public participation in environmental discussions are critical to raising issues of safety, health, social and economic impact, and whether the siting of a project is suitable for the location in which it is proposed.   HB 1301 will hinder Virginia's progress toward a clean economy by repealing Virginia's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Virginia's participation in RGGI is a successful effort to reduce pollution while directly helping communities on the front lines.   HB 5 diverts funding from the Community Flood Preparedness Fund (FUND) and creates a Flood Relief Fund. This is an inappropriate use of the RGGI funds. The existing FUND is already helping thousands of low-wealth families reduce energy bills and climate impacts, and localities deal with increasingly devastating floods.

I am particularly dismayed when those proposing these laws claim to be Christians.  In fact, passing these bills will ensure that we do the very opposite of what is a truly moral or Christian act.  It brings to mind the passage in Matthew 25:34-45.  Indeed if we claim that we have a moral authority of any kind - then we will not rescind our participation in the Greenhouse Gas Initiative, will not ensure that our environmental aspirations of caring for not only the Earth but those living in it then what can we truly say of ourselves as a state and a country?  I do not want to hear about the economic costs.  That is only a smokescreen to protect the proponents of this law from having to live with the consequences of passing these laws.  It really does come down to having a commitment to something far greater and more important than ourselves as individuals or our investments and bank accounts.  It is a matter of irreversible damage that cannot be undone once we have stepped over the place of no return.

We support HB1267 and HB1301.HB1267 repeals the LEV and ZEV emission program linking Virginia to the California Air Board and establishing a pathway to the regulatory moratorium on all internal combustion engines.HB1301 repeals the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that obfuscates its actual purpose - the participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - creating an estimated $280 million and growing annual tax on electricity.Further, the VMA asserts that CLIMATE CHANGE regulations must be exclusively addressed at the Federal level.  There is an inextricable linkage between environmental management and the making and moving of energy, products and people.  As such, economic prosperity, environmental protection, business consumption and human health are interdependent necessities of the U.S. economy. Federal and state administered EPA programs and policies to regulate the economy in order to slow or stop global warming should carefully balance these competing necessities throughrigorous scientific and economic standards.

If we do not take action and push legislation to protect our land and the animals that live on them, in the not to distant future they will become less and less until they are no more. Please think about this and help to do what you can to make positive change. "
Workman,Chesapeake ,,2022,HB1301,I feel strongly about banning killing contests of foxes and coyotes along with banning snare traps which mph are cruel and not necessary.

Knott,"Alexandria, VA",Outdoor Power Equipment Institute,2022,HB1337,The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute respectfully submits the attached comments in opposition to HB 1337 RE gas-powered leaf blowers.  Please do not hesitate to contact us directly if there are any questions or we can provide additional information regarding the subject concerns. 
Lowy,Fairfax County,Quiet Clean NOVA,2022,HB1337,"I’m Joan Lowy, director of Quiet Clean NOVA.Despite their relatively small size, gas-powered leaf blowers emit a tremendous amount of noise and pollution. HB1337 would enable local governments to regulate these machines. The bill is permissive – local governments aren’t required to take any action if they choose not to. If leaf blower noise and pollution isn’t an issue in your community, no problem. But public officials in communities where residents are complaining that gas-powered leaf blowers are disturbing their peace and fouling their air would be able to curb their use under HB1337. Please let the elected officials who are closest to the people decide what solution best fits their community.Gas-powered leaf blowers are typically used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass clipping. They generate an especially deep, oscillating noise. Research has shown that the noise from gas-powered leaf blowers travels farther and penetrates windows and walls more easily than other engine noise. It's like second-hand smoke – you can’t escape it. The seriousness of this problem is increasing as more people work and study at home.Most gas-powered leaf blowers have crude 2-stroke engines that use a mix of gas and oil. These are the same types of engines typically used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in many Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this obsolete technology, but its use continues unchecked in the U.S. landscape industry.About a third of that fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. This includes known carcinogens such as benzene, butadiene, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says a popular model gas-powered leaf blower emits as much smog-forming pollutants in ONE HOUR as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. A test by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke engine backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons and 23 times more carbon monoxide than a 6,200-pound Ford 150 Raptor pickup truck. We’re asking you to give us some relief. Please pass HB1337.Thank you for your consideration."
Baumeister,FALLS CHURCH,,2022,HB1337,"Please support HB1337 to empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers.   Lawn crews arrive at neighbors' yards at the crack of dawn and spend hours standing just around and blowing every single leave they can find, well beyond what is necessary to keep excess leaves from killing the grass.   They blow the leaves off of the driveway and sidewalks into the streets, and then they turn around and blow the leaves off of the street.And it is not just one neighbor.  As soon as one crew finishes, another crew starts up at another house, or multiple crews overlap at different neighbors, droning on and on and on in stereo.  All. day.  long.  All autumn long.  It ruins everybody else's right to quiet enjoyment of their property.  One really should be able to open the house's windows and enjoy nature when the summer temperatures finally break.  And it is not just in autumn.   It's more leave-blowing in the winter.  It's blowers for leaf-cleanup in the spring.  It's blowing grass clippings in the summer.  The homeowners may not even be aware of how long their lawn crews are there aggravating the neighbors because the homeowners commonly are away at work and don't have to deal with it themselves.  But it is certainly noticed by the neighbors who work from home.   "
Schor-MacDicken,Reston,,2022,HB1337,"I fully support HB1337. As a home owner and tax payer, I'm appalled by how prevalent these old fashioned nuisances have become year-round in VA. Gas powered leaf blowers are destructive to community air quality and cause horrific noise pollution. It's an antiquated technology that can easily be replaced by cleaner alternatives. The sooner they are banned the better, and the faster that cleaner alternatives will be embraced. Help Virginia be cleaner, less noisy, and smell less like gasoline year round! Offer incentives to move to cleaner alternatives, and we can put old fashioned fossil fuel based tech behind us. "
Ehmann,Fairfax County,,2022,HB1337,I strongly support Kaye Kory's Bill HB1337.  Polluting gas powered leaf blowers are a nuisance and are bad for the environment and the health of users.  Electric powered motors are much quieter and are a good alternative.  Noise knows no bounds and using gas powered motors disturbs the peace for the entire community.
Crawford,Page,,2022,HB1337,"Please save all of Virginias history, by leaving our monuments intact and historic memorabilia on display.  The Commonwealths history should not offend anyone who takes the time to understand it and respect the changes that occurred.  For instance Virginias State park history,  the Commonwealth’s Roadways or the quaint country town with the history of its namesake and deep rooted genealogy of the people who lived there. The Monuments are no different, they speak of times gone by, appreciated by some, disliked by others.  Maybe they are a symbol that change is needed and to remind us to do so, whatever the cause, our history brought us to this day in time. We need to respect each other’s heritage and appreciate how each native Virginian helped to shape all of us.Respectfully, Alan Crawford"
Flounders,Falls Church,,2022,HB1337,"We are strongly opposed to the loud and polluting gas powered motors that we hear and smell on Saturday and Sunday, oftentimes early in the morning.  They are not necessary, particularly in small back yards.   We strongly support Kaye Kory's Bill HB1337."
Golfer,Fairfax County,,2022,HB1337,"I would like to register my support of HB 1337 for the peace and health of the citizens of Fairfax County. I live in Lake Barcroft, a community with an enormous number of trees. The proliferation of noisy and polluting gas-powered leaf blowers seriously impinges on my and my neighbors enjoyment of our community, and impacts our health and welfare. Gas blowers are unregulated and spew air pollutants in incredibly higher quantities that automobiles. When landscape companies are working near our home, with two or three blowers going at the same time, we can smell the exhaust fumes on our property and the noise is deafening. Please give localities the power to regulate this equipment. There are battery-powered alternatives (I have one!) that are just as effective as the gas-powered blowers, and the trend nationwide in communities around the country is to get rid of these blowers and go green with battery-powered equipment. New landscaping companies are being established that solely use battery-operated and solar-charged landscaping equipment.  Fairfax County itself will phase out the use of gas-powered leaf blowers in county operations. Please pass this bill."
Picone,Falls Church,QC NOVA (Quiet Clean Northern Virginia),2022,HB1337,"Pass HB1337 (Kory)Gas-powered leaf blowers (GLBs) are disturbing the peace and fouling the air of Virginia communities. They are often used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass-clippings. Cities and counties are severely limited in their ability to curb the use of GLBs. HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines. With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem takes on greater urgency.BackgroundMost GLBs have crude 2-stroke engines that emit an oscillating noise research shows travels farther and is more likely to penetrate walls and windows than other types of engine noise. US health agencies consider 85 decibels to be the threshold at which hearing damage takes place. GLBs often measure over 100 decibels at the ear of the operator, which means people using them for just a few hours, such as lawn care workers, are likely to experience hearing loss. Even when measured from farther away, GLBs often exceed 70 decibels. The World Health Organization says outdoor noise over 55 decibels is disturbing to people.For their size, GLBs have an outsized impact on the environment. Their engines are similar to those used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in some Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this technology, but its use persists unchecked in the US lawn care industry. About a third of GLBs’ fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. These emissions include such known carcinogens as benzene, butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says using a popular model GLB for ONE HOUR emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. Tests by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons than a Ford 150 pickup truck.There are alternatives, including battery-powered leaf blowers. A growing number of landscape companies are using all-battery equipment – mowers, blowers, edgers, trimmers, etc. Often, they recharge batteries using mobile solar panels on the roofs of their trucks. They have made this switch because it’s good business. Battery equipment doesn’t have the same overhead as gas-powered machines. You don’t have to buy fuel or filters, and there’s less maintenance and fewer repairs. Companies say the return on investment over time is greater with battery equipment. Please empower local governments to nudge GLB users into modernizing their equipment for the health and tranquility of their communities."
Jones,"Lake Barcroft, Fairfax County",,2022,HB1337,"I strongly support HB1337, the bill giving local jurisdictions claim to regulate the use of gas powered leaf blowers.  The high decibel production of these tools causes hearing loss in the users and anyone in the immediate and relatively distant vicinity.  The exhaust emitted causes much air pollution.  The damage to wildlife--birds, the reproductive cycle of insects which feed birds, and humans is high.  Electric and battery powered blowers are quieter and pollute less.  Please, for the sake of our environment, our ecosystem, wild animals and humans, pass this bill.  Respectfully submitted.  Thank you for your time."
Brookes-Weiss ,Falls Church,,2022,HB1337," Please support HB 1337 to enable Virginia local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. Gas-powered leaf blowers emit high decibel levels of noise pollution which is incessant for months, every single day!  Gas blowers also emit massive amounts of carbon pollution. They cashed serious harm to lung health and heart health, not to mention mental health, with their constant awful noise.  They disturb the tranquility of the neighborhood, endanger the hearing and health of landscape workers forced to use them.  That’s a serious equity issue.  Noise levels exceed 100 decibels, producing a low-frequency roar that penetrates our entire neighborhood on a daily basis for months.  Pollutants include smog-forming nitrous oxides, greenhouse gas emissions, and carcinogenic hydrocarbons.  Additionally, gas blowers, with their blowing power,  blow off critical insect eggs from the leaves, the chrysalis of lunar moths and other pollinators, as well as the eggs of fireflies.  How much more must we disturb the eco balance of nature?  More than 100 communities across the United States now restrict or ban gas-powered leaf blowers, including Washington, DC.  I would like to see gas powered blowers completely eliminated, particularly because of their harm to the climate and wildlife.  Electric and battery operated blowers are very effective now and are far quieter and do not pollute as  much.  Please allow local governments to address the issue as needed, not only to restore peace and quiet but also reduce pollution."
Kerley,FALLS CHURCH,Kerley Associates International,2022,HB1337,"I strongly support HB1337 to give local jurisdictions the authority to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. The noise created by leaf blowers is ear shattering at its worst. The fumes are known to be extremely dangerous to our health as are the now proven ill effects of the noise. Further they are seemingly ever present.  They are as antiquated as buggy whips because new technology, including solar panel-powered machines, has provided workable and sustainable alternatives.  Find a way to help the “buggy-whip” companies and their employees transition to state-of-the-art tools and solve both problems... environmental preservation and employment generation. "
Taslitt,Fairfax,Quiet NOVA,2022,HB1337,"Please support (SB537 or HB1346). Because of the unregulated use of noisy, carcinogen-spewing gas-powered leaf blowers throughout our neighborhood and surrounding areas,  sitting outside is disrupted by the penetrating noise and fumes of gas-powered machines. Please empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers should they choose to do so. Your support of our quality of life is desperately needed. "
Roe,Charlottesville ,,2022,HB1337,"I strongly support this bill and urge lawmakers to pass it. The amount of emissions, air pollution and noise pollution produced by these machines is terrible, and most are produced by a relatively few companies and ppl while everyone else suffers. There is such a high externality cost produced. And there are much cleaner and quieter alternatives! We should phase out all Gas powered lawn tools and incentivize electric or manual counterparts. "
Troppe,ARLINGTON,,2022,HB1337,"I am writing in support of HB1337 that would authorize localities to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. It gives authority (but no requirement to act) to the unit of government closest to the people, and is not burdensome because of its phased-in approach. While I personally wouldn't oppose banning them altogether, this legislation is a reasonable approach to reducing toxic emissions, increasing workplace safety, and reducing noise pollution in our neighborhoods. Let's enable Virginia communities to join hundreds of other communities around the country to take this important step."
Holtz,Oakton,,2022,HB1337,"Please support Kaye Kory’s House Bill 1337 Gas-powered leaf blowers. The noise & air pollution produced by these machines is toxic to human health & the environment.

Charles,Arlington,,2022,HB1337,"I am in support of the restriction of two-stroke leaf blowers. These machines are a menace because is the pollution they emit, both sound and fumes, and are a hazard to all who are within earshot, mostly the users of them.Please ban these tools and instead require the use of electric-powered blowers."
McNicholas,Fairfax ,,2022,HB1337,"I urge the Assembly to pass this resolution banning gas blowers.  Small items like this have a huge impact on the quality of life.  If they were just used for a few short weeks during fall when leaves have fallen it would be tolerable but they are used weekly by every   Yard company to  blow cut grass from sidewalks, etc.  noise is a pollution.   It harms."
Hancock,Norfolk,,2022,HB1337,"Although this may seem to be a relatively small issue, small changes can have larger impacts. Allowing local governments to regulate gas leaf blowers could result in a larger shift towards electric leaf blowers that ends up reducing toxic emissions in a meaningful way. Supporting HB 1337 is an easy way to make a positive change for our communities."

HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines.  With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem has become more acute.GLB engines emit an oscillating noise that is louder, travels farther, and penetrates walls more easily than noise emitted by other types of engines.  Moreover, their inefficient 2-stroke engines generate staggering amounts of pollution.  About one-third of their fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air.

More than 150 communities around the country have already acted to curb the use of these noisy, filthy machines. There are several alternatives to GLBs, including battery-powered leaf blowers, which have been found to be just as effective and more economical over time.  HB1337 will not require anything of local governments.  Rather, it will simply give them the ability to take some action regarding leaf blowers if they choose to do so.

Busiahn,Falls Church,,2022,HB1337,"I strongly support HB1337, empowering local jurisdictions to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers.  The noise produced by these machines is obnoxious and dangerous for users and everyone in the neighborhood.  Many jurisdictions around the U.S. are regulating or banning gas-powered leaf blowers.  Fortunately alternatives are readily available in battery-powered electric equipment for homeowners and commercial landscapers.  This comment is in support of the grass-roots group Quiet Clean NOVA, which is educating neighbors and users about the problem and solutions."
Diliberti,FALLS CHURCH,,2022,HB1337,"I support this bill as a first step toward a quieter approach to landscaping and lawn care. We are a nation of inventors, and we can invent and use tools that are quieter and less harmful to humans and animals. Jurisdictions should have the ability to decide how to manage their landscapes to promote a healthy environment for all. "
Craig,Falls Church,Quiet Clean Northern Virginia,2022,HB1337,"This is a great initiative. It offers local communities a way to move forward in partnership with lawn care companies to limit and reduce the use of gas leaf blowers while ensuring that companies have time to adapt and sustain employment in this sector.  In general , gas blowers are terribly damaging to habitats and quite disruptive to study and work for the millions of Virginians at home during the working day. Their fumes are a menace - I have to run or walk to the opposite side of the street when I am near them, but workers are with them all day. I believe strongly that local communities best represent their citizens, not the distant state government in Richmond. Republicans and Democrats should embrace the rights of communities to set stricter limits on the use of gas leaf blowers by commercial companies.  It is true that electric blowers have limitations, which is why a period of regulation and adaptation is best for companies and homeowners to adapt, but we do need to begin this change.  This bill represents a great win for the health of Virginians and for the liveability of our communities. "
O'Neil,Fairfax County,,2022,HB1337,I strongly favor this bill. There are certain areas in which regulation is appropriate and the counties and cities are the appropriate level. 
Mueller,Falls Church,,2022,HB1337,"Dear Legislators, the level of noise in my community caused by leaf-blowing, snow-blowing, and other landscape activities powered by gas equipment is deafening and constant. I have had to resort to wearing noise-blocking ear muffs of the kind used at airports by runway personnel just to be able to have peace inside my own home.   The many months of the year when I am no longer able to enjoy my outdoor space is increasing because of the incessant noise.  None of this is necessary when there are environmentally healthier and efficient options.  Please support HB 1337 for the peace and health of the citizens of the Commonwealth.  Thank you"
Vinograd-Bausell,Falls Church,Self,2022,HB1337,"I am writing to ask you to support Kaye Kory’s House Bill 1337 Gas-powered leaf blowers; local regulation, civil penalty.  When we bought a house in a forested lake community, we thought that we would be spending our retirement years in a nature-lovers’ paradise with a peaceful quality of life.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Because of the unregulated use of noisy, carcinogen-spewing gas-powered leaf blowers throughout our neighborhood and surrounding areas, we might as well be living in a construction zone seven days a week from dawn until dusk. There is never a time when we can sit outside with friends or take a dip in the lake without the infernal penetrating noise and fumes of these antiquated, unregulated machines. The stress is overwhelming for adults and children alike, and the  medical literature documents the consequences on our health and hearing.  Please empower local governments to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers should they choose to do so.  Your support of our quality of life is desperately needed."
Kent,Great Falls,,2022,HB1337,"One of the good things about this time of year is that there is no noise and air pollution being generated by gasoline leaf blowers in our neighborhood.  It won’t be long, however, when the landscape companies return to our street with these obnoxious machines.  For most of the year, it is almost a daily occurrence, sometimes  even on weekends.  The noise  even can begin  before and after normal work hours. And, unless you pass HB 1337, our local authorities continue to be almost powerless to mitigate the problem .Aside from the fact that these devices are annoying, research has shown they are highly polluting, as much as 20 times the pollution caused by a mid-sized gasoline-powered passenger car. Plus, there are alternatives, such as battery operated leaf blowers.This bill deftly avoids the sledge-hammer approach of a state-wide regulation, but allows local jurisdictions—if they so choose—to make specific requirements that account for their situation.  I urge you to report this bill to the House of Delegates for a vote.Thank you,Robin KentGreat Falls, VA"
Garland,Dublin,,2022,HB1337,"Dear Counties, Cities and Towns Committee, Being residents of Dublin, Ireland, we can't vote in Virginia elections, but as  impacts us, we decided to write to you.  Please support HB1337 to regulate gas-powered leaf blowers. We haven't visited our two daughters, one in Virginia, one in Maryland, for a decade because of infernal noise from their neighbors' lawn mowers, and when this is over, just when we think we'll get some peace and quiet, out come the blowers, blowing largely nothing. We were thinking of coming in the winter, but the weather is cold, and gas-powered blowers are still used. These machines are used year round, and the noise travels easily through walls of homes. At no time of the year is there respite from the noise.Being in our 80s, we depend on a good two-hour nap every afternoon - as do many old people. Or else we can't make it through to the evening. As the households of our daughters are busy and chaotic, weather permitting, we prefer to set up our chairs under a shady tree and nap there. Our being outside also gives the families space. We don't want to be under their feet all day. We also spend the afternoon reading out on the deck - again to give the families space - but we have to come inside when lawn crews arrive. Long visits can be stressful to hosts!We enjoy family meals on the deck - but again these are often disrupted by landscaper crews, and we have to grab plates, glasses, silverware, and dishes to scurry inside to shelter from the noise - 15 to 20 minutes per yard for summer mow 'n' blows, and up to an hour in leaf season. Such obtrusive interruptions is no way to enjoy family life. In densely populated areas, why are 100 dB-level engines, permitted on a routine basis, when quiet alternatives exist? Battery lawn mowers are no noisier than dishwashers. Battery blowers are less noisy and are emission-free.  Best of all are rakes. Is the lower cost of gas mowers and blowers, given the noise and dirty emissions, really worth the disruption to the quality of life?You have beautiful tall trees in Virginia - but the price for having them, it seems, is the frantic and noisy removal of all their fallen leaves.When I bring up this issue to others, I've been told it would harm the livelihoods of thousands of workers. Has this been the case in cities with gas blower bans or restrictions? If so, do we permit loud disruptive noise because this loud disruptive noise helps employ people? Surely a business is there to serve the needs of society, not vice versa.Republicans and Democrats, protecting the quality of life should be a common sense, non-partisan issue. Any measure that can regulate gas mowers or gas blowers is a win for peace and quiet in Virginia neighborhoods.Vote yes for HB1337!Sincerely,Roger and Lal Garland43 Butterfield Drive,Dublin,Ireland"
Garland,Vienna,,2022,HB1337,"Regulating gas leaf blowers should be a totally bi-partisan issue. Every day of the year, the noise and pollution from these filthy 2-stroke engines fills our streets and homes, degrading the quality of life in communities all over the U.S.And it is NOT A MATTER OF FREE CHOICE as to how one moves one's leaves. Gas leaf blowers don't just drive leaves to the curb, they also drive people raking back into their homes. If neighbor A is blowing his leaves, neighbor B won't rake his at the same time. Likewise, those gardening or just sitting outside enjoying their yards are driven indoors. Friends or family sharing a meal on their deck have to get up and continue their meal elsewhere. Most of us spend at least 30 years working to pay for our homes and we are entitled to the rightful use and enjoyment of our own properties. We rely on our homes for peace and quiet. They are our sanctuaries from an often harsh and unfair world. Hence, no one should have to tolerate loud noise invading their homes and yards without a compelling reason.Loud noise in neighborhoods should be limited to the providers of emergency services and the occasional setting off of fireworks.Using gas leaf blowers in residential areas is not just inconsiderate, it is anti-social and should be strongly discouraged. Localities must have the authority to curb the plague of noise and toxic fumes these machines inflict upon them on a daily basis. Let's put peace before profits! Please support HB1337."
Kuhlmann,Arlington,N/A,2022,HB1337,"Leaf blowers in residential neighborhoods severely disrupt taxpayers' quality of life from March through December - 10 full months of the year. They disrupt sleep. They disrupt work. They disrupt conversations, phone calls, and Zoom meetings.  They persist daily, from dawn 'til dark. They cause anxiety and other health issues, especially ill health effects resulting from disrupted sleep. The health-injuring noise is utterly inescapable, as it penetrates walls and permeates every inch of indoor space.  Toxic fumes from inconsiderate neighbors' daily use also penetrate indoor space, causing further health injury.  Despite the fact that these public NUISANCES wildly exceed noise code decibel limits, local authorities claim that noise ordinances are ""unenforceable,"" and so they abdicate responsibility for protecting taxpayers from that persistent nuisance. These same local bureaucrats claim that ""if only the State would grant us power to regulate, we could address the problem."" Well, State, here is your chance: DO SOMETHING! Pass H.R.1337. Thank you."
Krimgold,Fairfax County,Faith Alliance for Climae Solutions,2022,HB1337,Please support HB 1337 tallow for local regulation of gas-powered leaf blowers. They prepresent a serious threat to the health and safety of residents and the machine operators.Localities should have the right to regulate use according to their specific conditions and needs.
Davis,Alexandria,Myself and Quiet Clean NOVA,2022,HB1337,"Please make this as strong as possible so communities can  have control over the noise and pollution in their very back yards. It is hugely important for access to a safe , happy and healthy life.  So many other cities are cutting the way for this, and DC has banned them along with Miami Beach! And California!Thank you"
dresdner,vienna,Mr. & Mrs.,2022,HB1337,I support a total ban on gas powered leaf blowers.   HB 1337  is inadequate because it does not allow communities the option of banning and prohibiting these obnoxious and very loud polluting machines.
Lowy,Fairfax County,Quiet Clean NOVA,2022,HB1337,"Gas-powered leaf blowers (GLBs) are disturbing the peace and fouling the air of Virginia communities. They are often used three-quarters of the year, mostly to blow grass-clippings. Cities and counties are severely limited in their ability to curb the use of GLBs. HB1337 would enable – but not require – local officials to regulate these noisy, polluting machines. With more Virginians working and studying at home, this problem takes on greater urgency.BackgroundMost GLBs have crude 2-stroke engines that emit an oscillating noise research shows travels farther and is more likely to penetrate walls and windows than other types of engine noise. US health agencies consider 85 decibels to be the threshold at which hearing damage takes place. GLBs often measure over 100 decibels at the ear of the operator, which means people using them for just a few hours, such as lawn care workers, are likely to experience hearing loss. Even when measured from farther away, GLBs often exceed 70 decibels. The World Health Organization says outdoor noise over 55 decibels is disturbing to people.For their size, GLBs have an outsized impact on the environment. Their engines are similar to those used in the motorized rickshaws that have contributed mightily to the choking air pollution in some Asian cities. The rest of the world is moving away from this technology, but its use persists unchecked in the US lawn care industry. About a third of GLBs’ fuel is released UNCOMBUSTED into the air. These emissions include such known carcinogens as benzene, butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. The California Air Resources Board says using a popular model GLB for ONE HOUR emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a Toyota Camry 1,100 miles. Tests by the Edmunds car journal, with help from AAA, found that a 2-stroke backpack leaf blower emitted 300 times more hydrocarbons than a Ford 150 pickup truck.There are alternatives, including battery-powered leaf blowers. A growing number of landscape companies are using all-battery equipment – mowers, blowers, edgers, trimmers, etc. Often, they recharge batteries using mobile solar panels on the roofs of their trucks. They have made this switch because it’s good business. Battery equipment doesn’t have the same overhead as gas-powered machines. You don’t have to buy fuel or filters, and there’s less maintenance and fewer repairs. Companies say the return on investment over time is greater with battery equipment. Please empower local governments to nudge GLB users into modernizing their equipment for the health and tranquility of their communities."

The act has established the Commonwealth as a national leader in the fight against climate change, being the first state in the South to set a 100% clean energy standard and commit to a zero-carbon electricity grid. By allowing this bill to pass, it will repeal additional provisions of the VCEA, including certain EJ reporting requirements and encourage the production of nuclear development that can harm the environment and the citizens of Virginia as well.

Merchant,Martinsville,,2022,HB656,No tax credits for fossil fuels. 
Granger,Suffolk,,2022,HB656,"As a solar owner for 12 years, I know that renewable energy and a cleaner environment is the future.  Those who support coal and waste byproducts are losing the tide.  I do not want this legislation approved."
Barnes,Big Stone Gap,Appalachian Voices,2022,HB656,"On behalf of Appalachian Voices, our organization opposes this bill. While the clean-up of GOB is crucially important to improving the environment in Southwest Virginia, this tax credit is unnecessary. Dominion Energy is already burning coal refuse at the VCHEC without tax incentives; so far more than 4 million tons of gob have been burned at VCHEC. The plant was designed for this purpose, and is doing so as designed. While there is an enormous amount of GOB left to be cleaned up in SWVA, the Federal government just recently enacted the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes an $11.3 billion investment into cleaning up abandoned coal features. Virginia will receive 10 times as much funding for abandoned coal mine land clean-up funding for the next 15 years, which can go toward cleaning up the highest-priority GOB sites. Creating a tax credit for burning GOB puts an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. Finally, SB 120 (Hackworth) and HB 657 (Wampler) propose to inventory and study how to best clean up GOB piles in Southwest Virginia. The General Assembly should wait for the results of this study before creating tax credits to incentivize burning GOB in power plants. Please oppose this bill."
Shelton,"Whitesburg, KY",Appalachian Citizens' Law Center,2022,HB656,"My name is Rebecca Shelton and I am submitting comments on behalf of Appalachian Citizens' Law Center, a public interest law firm and non-profit advocacy organization that works in and represents clients from Eastern Kentucky and Southwest Virginia. We oppose this bill. This bill creates a tax credit to incentivize the burning of coal refuse, or gob. We see this as unnecessary for two primary reasons. First, Dominion Energy, without this credit, is already burning coal refuse at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center in Wise County, Virginia. The plant was designed for this purpose and creating a credit is unnecessary.Second, the federal government recently enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill which adds $11.3 billion dollars to the federal abandoned coal mine grant program. Over the next fifteen years, Virginia will receive nearly 10 times as much federal funding for the clean up of gob and other abandoned coal features compared to recent years. Given this infusion of federal funds, creating a state tax incentive to clean up gob is unwarranted at this time. In addition to being unnecessary, the bill incentivizes the use of gob but it does not require that the gob be from Virginia in order to be eligible for the tax credit. As the tax credit cap is greater than the amount of funding that has been identified as needed for gob cleanup in Virginia (according to Virginia' s coal mine inventory), the tax credit would likely be used to truck waste coal into Southwest Virginia; Virginia taxpayers would be subsidizing the cleanup of coal-mining waste.We ask you to vote against HB656. Though gob cleanup is critical for Southwest Virginia, we've seen no evidence to support the mechanism through which that bill proposes to achieve that - incentivizing an activity that is already occurring - and believe that the federal AML funds, instead, will help address this issue. Thank you for allowing me to provide testimony. "
Pender,Hampton,Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB656,"A 2011 Harvard report found that the life cycle effects of coal and the waste stream generated are costing the U.S. public a third to over one-half of a trillion dollars annually. The HB 656 bill uses taxpayer money to incentivize the burning of coal refuse at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center (VCHEC). The excessive use of burning coal refuse would put communities along the transportation path at risk of environmental disasters and become more exposed to harmful emissions. Also, HB 656 creates a nonrefundable income tax credit for Dominion Energy for 2023-2027 equal to $4/ton of qualified coal refuse used to generate electricity at VCHEC.   This bill will not only harm Virginia environmentally, but economically as well. And it is for these reasons, CCAN Action Fund opposes this bill HB656."
Selvage,Wise,,2022,HB656,"SUMMARY: Kathy Selvage of Wise, VA addresses the VA Assembly Subcommittee on Finance regarding HB 656: Dominion’s power plant in Wise County, VA was a boondoggle when proposed and it continues to be. Life extension for the plant last year was granted. Currently, the SB 120 is attempting to rename Garbage of Bituminous (GOB) as a renewable energy. This is an alternative truth. The economic viability of the plant and industry are enhanced by subsidies (HB 656) through tax reductions that robs the tax coffers, and further increases their economic viability by tossing the health and environmental costs onto the community and its inhabitants. The Commonwealth is proposing the same path as Pennsylvania as they have the most waste burning plants in the nation and try to include waste coal in their renewable portfolio. GOB is low energy producing (60%), forcing the use of more GOB, heavily laden with pollutants, and produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH’s) during incineration. Pollutants are displaced from the air, never eradicated, and reappear in the toxic waste coal ash at about 85% of the entire amount of GOB used, thus creating mountains of toxic coal ash. There are safer ways to deal with the GOB piles of far southwest Virginia than this proposed scheme. Population loss in a single decade for Wise County reached 14.7% or 5,308 as the young and college educated continue their flight in search of opportunity. Their future cannot be found in a GOB pile. This plan makes the continued destruction of Wise County legal and is absolutely the wrong trajectory."

Berthoud,Buckingham,"Friends of Buckingham, Virginia Community Rights Network",2022,HB250,"Thank you for supporting HB250. I see the other commenters have spoken well to this issue. Addressing one of your foremost concerns, there would be no additional funding required in order to incorporate the requests of this bill into the already funded project of HB2213, and the State Agency Committee. To pause permitting of the mining of gold, copper, lead and zinc while this study is conducted makes good common sense. Let's scrutinize what we have before allowing further problems into our state. We know the current regulations are not up to protecting us from modern large scale mining. There are many concerns about large scale mining: dewatering, airborne toxic particulate matter, poisoning of the local groundwater & drinking water downstream, catastrophic waste-holding dam failures, economic devastation to local communities due to the short term and boom & bust nature of metallic mining. One of the most concerning aspects of mining, the use of very toxic chemicals such as cyanide and mercury to separate the metals from the ore - we find that there are no! regulations. That alone should cause an urgent pause. Talk of well paying jobs unfortunately is not well founded. The large mining companies would bring in their own skilled peoples and  specialized equipment. Again, since funding may be your primary concern, to pause permitting could save the state from extensive externalized costs. Thanks for supporting HB250.

Holmes,Culpeper,Piedmont Environmental Council,2022,HB250,"On behalf of the Piedmont Environmental Council, we urge you to support HB250. The legislation adds copper, zinc and lead to the current study analyzing the impacts of industrial gold mining and places a temporary pause in permitting for this mining until the study is completed. The commonwealth must ensure our regulatory programs are protective of the public health and our natural resources, especially threats to water quality from acid mine drainage and other harmful pollutants associated with mining and processing. The pause is essential to ensure measures recommended for protection of the public health and environment are in place prior to the commencement of any mining activities. Thank you."

Rinaldi,Buckingham,Press Pause Coalition,2022,HB250,"Please vote in favor of HB250. This is a bill that promotes good governance and does not impact current business. HB250 capitalizes on work already being done by the Commonwealth in its study of the impacts of gold mining. Virginia can  utilize the state agency committee established for that study to accomplish the requirements of HB250, because copper, lead, and zinc are mined in a similar manner. This bill asks only that the Commonwealth take measures to prepare for a potential future industry of metal mining, which uses new and different techniques that were not practiced when the current regulations were written. Please vote in favor of this bill. Respectfully, Stephanie Rinaldi"
Oba,Buckingham ,Friends of Buckingham ,2022,HB250,"As president of Friends of Buckingham, I ask that you vote in support of HB250.  Industrial-scale mining of copper, lead, and zinc has not been done in Virginia in many decades, but exploration for these metals has recently begun in multiple Virginia counties.  HB250 gives Virginia the opportunity to review its regulations for large-scale copper, zinc, and lead mining operations, which could impact the drinking water sources of communities adjacent or downstream of a metals-containing geological belt that crosses the state – including our community in Buckingham. It is crucial that Virginia be proactive in addressing these operations, which in a modern context are new to the Commonwealth.  HB250 allows for this by establishing a review of the regulations for industrial mining of copper, zinc, and lead while pausing permits for these metals and gold (whose regulations are currently being reviewed) until the analyses are complete.  The bill does not affect any other mining or any current or pending operations.Please vote in support of HB250.Chad Oba,President, Friends of Buckingham"
Fanning,City of Richmond ,Chesapeake Bay Foundation ,2022,HB250,"The Chesapeake Bay Foundation writes in support of HB250.  This bill will build upon ongoing work analyzing the sufficiency of Virginia's regulatory programs to protect the Commonwealth's natural resources from the effects of industrial gold mining to also address impacts related to commercial metals mining of copper, zinc and lead, for which exploratory efforts are underway.  While this study effort is ongoing, the bill would also provide for a temporary pause in permitting for large-scale mining of gold, copper, lead, and zinc until the study is completed. Studying the potential impacts from these sorts of mining operations will ensure sufficient regulatory programs are in place to protect our natural resources, including water quality, downstream drinking water sources, and the Chesapeake Bay. "
Lovelace,Bedford County,Press Pause Coalition,2022,HB250,"I urge you to vote in support of HB250.  This bill gives Virginia the chance to employ best practice in regards to large-scale copper, lead, and zinc mining.  These operations have not been seen in Virginia for a very long time, and Virginia’s regulations have not been evaluated in light of modern mining techniques for these metals.  Further, the bill does not impact business in that it has no impact any other types of mining, and there are no current or pending operations that could be affected.  Potentially mineable areas are adjacent and downstream to the drinking water sources of countless Virginians across the state.  Metals mining often uses toxic chemicals, like cyanide, in processing the metals, and the impacts from these operations and resulting waste materials on water quality and resources are well-documented.  A review of regulations and impacts of large-scale copper, zinc, and lead mining, while pausing permitting until the analyses are complete, is critical.  It is also urgent, as exploration for these metals has begun in multiple localities.  Again, I ask that you please vote in support of HB250.Stacy Lovelace"
Sims,Richmond,Appalachian Voices,2022,HB250,"On behalf of the organization Appalachian Voices, and our members across Virginia, including many of your constituents, I ask you to please support HB250.  Addressing the existing, and likely outdated regulatory framework for commercial metals mining of copper, zinc and lead is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of  Virginia's drinking water supplies.As exploratory efforts intended for large-scale processing of these metals are now occurring, HB250 would make sure existing bonding, reclamation, closure, and monitoring regulations are evaluated and updated. Of particular concern is the potential impacts from processing of these metals, which can include use of toxic materials, or result in large amounts of waste material. HB250 also provides for a pause on permits for large-scale mining of gold, copper, lead, and zinc until those regulations are analyzed.  This does not impact other types of mining such as aggregate, and does not interfere with any current or pending permits. Gathering information and analyzing regulations that protect our drinking water before permits are permissible is good governance, and serves public health. I respectfully ask you to please support HB250 from Delegate Shelly Simonds.Jessica Sims, Virginia Field Coordinator, Appalachian Voices"

[RPS-George Wythe High School] needs this additional revenue to build new schools and modernize facilities to improve the learning experience of its students. According to the Virginia Department of Education, more than half of the state’s school buildings are more than 50 years old. Unfortunately, my community is home to several of these outdated buildings including George Wythe High School. Students and teachers are placed in unsafe environments that may have leaky roofs, windowless classrooms, mold, poor ventilation, and broken HVAC systems. It is not helpful to the learning environment and development of children to attend school in buildings that harm their health and well-being. Having the sales tax as an option will give us the opportunity to fix the crumbling schools in my school district. I am afraid that if the General Assembly doesn’t pass this bill, another generation of students will be forced to sit in outdated, 50-year old classrooms that are inadequate for what students need today.Please prioritize education and the future of our commonwealth by taking this necessary step to invest in our schools, our students, and our community.Thank you so much for listening and remember #WytheCantWait #AllRPSCantWait #WeAreRPS"

Many members of our faith communities are elderly, disabled, low income or have young children.  This bill would set standards for utility (electric, gas, water) disconnections during crises (e.g., pandemic) and severe cold and heat periods.    Giving people a grace period during crises and extreme weather just makes sense.  It's humane.   It is the right thing to do.   The utilities are publicly regulated monopolies.  It is not a hardship for them to receive delayed payments.   It is a life threatening crisis if members of our faith communities and other poor Virginians do not have vital service during a crisis or extreme weather emergency."

Pender,Hampton,Chesapeake Climate Action Network,2022,HB1204,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency reports that between 1980 and 2019, CO2 emissions increased by 11 percent. Despite great progress in air quality improvement, approximately 97 million people nationwide lived in counties with pollution levels above the primary NAAQS in 2020. HB1204 will slow the adoption of clean energy in Virginia and gut the Renewable Energy Credit (RECs), and rooftop solar/distributed generation market, putting us further behind in our efforts to decarbonize our grid. Additionally, the bill rolls back the long-standing authority of the Air Pollution Control Board to make determinations related to minor new source review (air pollution) permits. Virgnina’s Air Pollution Control Board meets and deliberates in public, while receiving input and votes from citizens in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  By allowing HB1204 to pass, it will minimize public engagement & participation as well as government transparency that occurs with the full review by the Air Pollution Control Board.  And it is for these reasons, CCAN Action Fund opposes this bill HB1204."

As a public high school school teacher and parent of two young children (ages 5 and 2) in Virginia, I have serious concerns that this bill will wind up doing more harm than good for the children of our state. I have worked in two different public school systems in Virginia over 13 years, and I have seen first hand how beneficial counseling services can be to a wide variety of students. If parents are allowed to prohibit their students from accessing counseling services in the school, these students may be cut off from not only critical mental health support, but but also the academic, career, and community support that school counselors and mental health team members provide. All members of a school mental health team must undergo rigorous education before obtaining their licenses, and as such they should be trusted as the professionals they are to provide only services that they deem necessary for students well-being.I strongly urge you to let the trained mental health professionals do their jobs. Don't make students get tied in the mire of adult squibbles.Thank you,Sara WatkinsMotherTeacherConcerned Virginia Citizen"

Sims,Richmond,Appalachian Voices,2022,HB1228,"I am writing on behalf of Appalachian Voices, and our members, many of whom are your constituents, in support of HB 1228. Currently, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality cannot know whether water quality will be lowered by a proposed project—or by how much—because the “baseline” condition of the water is oftentimes unknown. HB 1228 adds a layer of data-based review that benefits the DEQ's overall processes, and is necessary tool for anti-degradation analysis.By requiring project applicants to submit information regarding the current condition of the water and their proposed projects’ potential impacts, HB 1228 will enable the DEQ to make better-informed decisions and comply with current law. This data requirement would only need to occur if the waterbody is not already impaired, or appropriate data is not already available. The bill will also help DEQ avoid additional water testing and provide water quality data for future reference.Please support HB 1228."
Sligh,Charlottesville,Wild Virginia,2022,HB1228,"Wild Virginia supports this bill. Virginia already has the duty to perform the kind of antidegradation analyses that are addressed in this proposal, under both state law and the Clean Water Act. No credible antidegradation analysis can be done without characterizing existing or ""baseline"" conditions in a waterbody that would be affected by a permitted discharge. The primary value of this bill would be to ensure that the baseline is documented to support the permitting decisions. Requiring that applicants seeking to possibly lower the quality of the waters that belong to us all, to provide data by which to judge the legality of their proposed discharges, is appropriate, given constraints on agency resources. It is important to note that the amended language need not present an undue burden on either DEQ or applicants. In many cases waterbodies are already impaired, so the changes would require no additional work or cost for either the agency or dischargers. In other cases DEQ has access to adequate data and can waive the requirement for further information on the same parameters from the applicant. "
Goodrum,"Charlottesville, Virginia",Wild Virginia ,2022,HB1228,"My name is Jacqueline Goodrum and I am a resident of Albemarle County.  I comment today in my professional capacity as Conservation Policy Associate for Wild Virginia, a statewide non-profit organization seeking to protect Virginia's water quality.I urge you to support HB1228 because it ensures that DEQ/State Water Control Board will make data-based decisions when considering whether to authorize an activity that would lower water quality. Section 62.1-44.4 of the Virginia Code allows DEQ/Board to authorize an activity that would lower water quality, however DEQ/Board must know the baseline quality of a water body before DEQ/Board can say whether or not the proposed activity will lower water quality. DEQ/Board requires this data before it can make a decision because DEQ/Board must consider all relevant water quality data, including a water body's baseline condition. HB1228 seeks to ensure DEQ/Board meet current legal requirements for agency decision-making concerning proposed activities that lower water quality by requiring DEQ to document baseline water quality for biological and chemical indicators. This not only protects water quality, but also helps DEQ/Board compile and acquire the data needed to support their decision. Importantly, HB1228 does not place the burden of data collection on DEQ; rather it authorizes the agency to require permit applicants to provide sufficient water quality related data and information to the agency for DEQ/Board to make their decision about the applicant's proposed activity. As such, HB1228 promises to save DEQ/Board precious agency resources while simultaneously providing the agency with quantitative water quality data and information that it can use for future reference. d may authorize activities that would lower water quality if the activity is justified by “necessary economic or social development” and if other requirements are met. However, DEQ cannot know whether water quality will be lowered—or by how much—unless the agency knows what the underlying or “baseline” condition of the water is."

Stevenson,Lewes,Caesar Rodney Institute,2022,HB118,"Public comments on HB118HB118 is critical to maintaining competitive electric rates in Virginia, and to maintaining reliable power generated in the Commonwealth.  Key components of the bill repeal Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), and returns power to the State Corporation Committee to protect electric customers from excessive rate increases.  Our analysis shows without HB118 electric rates may rise 60% to 100% by 2030, and the negative impact on the economy could be $10 to $16.5 billion a year.Virginia’s RGGI carbon tax started in January 2021, and solar power generation more than doubled to 4% of electric demand as the impact of the VCEA kicked in.  Consequently, According to the US Energy Information Agency, ten months of real data shows the fallacies of Virginia’s RGGI carbon tax program when compared to the same ten months in 2020.  In-state electric generation fell 9% as natural gas-fired power plants lost against regional electric grid bids from non-carbon tax states with 10% to 13% lower cost. Virginia generators will lose about $330 million in generation revenue in 2021.  The bottom-line result was residential electric bills would likely rise to $80 per year in just the first year.The RGGI tax actually increased global emissions by about 390,000 tons as imports have higher emissions after transmission losses, and the generation system mix are considered. Increased solar generation replaced zero-emitting nuclear and hydroelectric power 58% of the time, with the balance of offsets coming from low emission natural gas leading to, at best, 340,000 tons of emission savings.  So, in reality, there may have been no emissions savings as intermittent solar power usually requires increased backup power from less efficient, fast start oil and natural gas generators. Even if the 14 million ton emission goal for 2030 was met, an EPA calculator shows global temperatures would only fall 0.004° F.The loss of in-state generation will continue as RGGI allowance prices continue to rise and perhaps double. Importing power adds cost to cover the greater transmission losses and congestion at key transmission sub-stations. Well-paying jobs at the power plants would be lost, which has secondary impacts on the economy. RGGI may have a cumulative direct negative impact on Virginia’s economy of $4.5 to $7.2 billion by 2030, or $10.3 to $16.5 billion if indirect and induced effects are included. Local power plants are needed to maintain voltage stability for reliability, and longer transmission lines could face more likely storm damage and outages.Dominion Energy provides 80% of Virginia’s electricity and plans to replace natural gas generation with wind, solar, and battery backup power to meet the VCEA state mandates. The utility commission determined that the plan would raise residential electric rates by $800 a year by 2030, with industrial rates rising by millions. The residential cost estimate rises to $1,500 a year, adding in needed transmission and distribution line additions to bring wind and solar power from distant locations, using actual residential demand, and removing the utility commission assumption customers in North Carolina will share the cost. Large increases in industrial electric bills would likely lead to companies moving elsewhere taking high-paying jobs with them.  "
Vance,Clover,,2022,HB118,"I am writing to ask that HB118 be passed to eliminate the VCEA legislation. The VCEA will increase my electric bill above an already large part of my monthly fixed income. As a senior, I am reeling from constant price increases from food, cable. phone, and other necessary things to live with. The VCEA will help turn our commonwealth into an ugly landscape loaded with solar farms and windmills, and put our power generation at risk, when there is no need to do so. We cannot allow this landscape destruction to happen. Please pass HB118 and save Virginia's taxpayers from the VCEA.  Thank you.Mr. Vance "

Croney,Thayer,America,2022,HB118,"Dear People,All the noise being made about climate control and the carbon footprint is just that - noise. Their computer models are built on estimations instead of facts! And, it is a real fact that what this bill seeks to do will do more harm to our people than you have thought about, and absolutely nothing to help the climate. Our people are struggling already, and this is one more silly offer from people to far away from our reality to notice. Fossil fuels are by far the best way for us to heat our homes and transport to work. Please, stop listening to the people who think up this crap in offices but never have to live with their own ideas. If they did, they'd shut up.Thanks"

Michaels,Marshall,,2022,HB118,"I had the privilege to serve as the Virginia State Climatologist from 1980 to 2007, including a term as President of the American Association of State Climatologists. I tender my comments on HB118 after this considerable time in public service.HB118 mitigates some provisions in the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act, but it does not go far enough.  While I support its passage, I believe that a clean and simple repeal of the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act will ultimately be more in order, because all systematic emissions reductions programs in Virginia are both expensive and climatically futile.The standard model to assess the climate impact of proposed policies is housed at the Biden Administration’s EPA, and is called the “Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-Gas Induced Climate Change.”Under standard and common assumptions about future climate change (which themselves may be questionable, likely assuming too much warming), the EPA model calculates that if total US emissions were reduced to zero in the early 21st century, and then kept there until 2100, the amount of global warming that would be prevented from now until then is around 0.13⁰C. But Virginia’s emissions are only about 3% of the US total, which means that nearly a century of zero Virginia emissions would result in a reduction in global warming of approximately 0.004 of a degree (C).For comparative purposes, China’s emissions are currently about twice those of the US, and they are likely to stabilize around 2030, when they will easily be three times ours. India is also rapidly electrifying via coal-fired generation. In this perspective, the US is rapidly on the way to being a minor player in global carbon dioxide emissions, with a truly negligible contribution from Virginia. By 2030, China’s emissions alone will climatically swamp any US reductions every year.While I think HB118 should pass the House of Delegates, it may have a difficult time in the Senate.  A cleaner future Bill, in what is likely to be a very different political climate (both Houses of the General Assembly are likely to be Republican), would be a simple repeal of the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act in the 2024 legislative session, which will then be signed into law by Governor Youngkin. Passing HB118 is a first step in this direction, despite its uncertain future in this Session."

Dwyer,Springfield,,2022,HB118,"The Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) is clearly the most radical and wasteful energy and climate legislation ever passed in the history of our Commonwealth.  It will most direly impact Virginia's poorer families, since it will cost Virginia families and businesses a ridiculous $2 billion per year -- which works out to $800 annually for a family of four!  And, it requires the destruction of 770 square miles of farmlands and forests, which is over 30 times the size of New York City.While seeming to be noble and full of great potential, solar and wind energy have proven time and time again to be unreliable and intermittent when most needed, causing grid destabilization and blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.Virginia needs to act wisely and learn from these mistakes.I strongly urge the passage of HB118, to roll back the dangerous statewide Green New Deal initiatives. "
Cameron,Fairfax County,,2022,HB118,"Regarding HB 118, renewable energy projects need to be subject to full-blown environmental reviews.  They should not be exempt from any related regulatory or public involvement processes.  Environmental reviews of renewable energy projects should include an assessment of whether the project would impact the critical habitat of Federally listed endangered species, or potentially result in a prohibited taking of these species.  There are many such species listed in Virginia.  In addition, environmental reviews  of solar projects must include an assessment of the impacts of erosion that may result from clearing land for solar farms, resulting in increased stormwater runoff carrying sediment that may harm the water quality of streams, lakes, and the Chesapeake Bay, and smother associated fish and wildlife aquatic habitat.The environmentally damaging procedural flaws in VCEA require that it be repealed."
Elliott,Guthrie,,2022,HB118,"Think carefully about this energy bill.  You don't want to end up like Germany.  Shutting down working nuclear power plants and then trying to make do with solar panels in a climate that is not suitable for them.  (Cloudy days and snow.) Wind energy requires an enormous investment in battery technology and takes up large swaths of land while killing large numbers of birds.  At the same time, Germany is also becoming dependent on Russia for natural gas, which is going to cost them in the long run.  Let the free market determine what works."
Hammel,Allentown PA,,2022,HB118,Green energy should be left to succeed on it's own merits and not forced upon a population ill suited to adapt. Like petroleum replaced whale oil and other things evolved over time.  in truth I suspect this is driven more by patronage and favor than by any real concern. There are huge amounts of money at stake and the welfare of the general population will be sacrificed in the process without regard.  Practical thinking must prevail.  Do any of the politicians in favor of this course of action realize that they may still be in office when the devastating effects take place ? They should have to answer for themselves.  The foresight they claim is only for their benefit. 
Mullinger,"Findlay, OHIO",,2022,HB118,"I see there is a bill, HB 118, to repeal and replace the misbegotten Virginia Clean Economy Act.  I urge you to pass it.""Clean"" energy is extremely expensive and wasteful energy, and not even particularly clean.  Solar and wind are intermittent, cutting out or falling sharply when the wind blows too weakly or strongly, or when clouds block the Sun.  They cannot provide the reliable baseload power a modern economy needs in order to operate.  Batteries are low power and expensive.  Hence, the backup for the intermittent windmills and solar panels is usually fossil fuels, but consumed in wasteful stop/start mode instead of efficient baseload mode.  This means essentially paying for double coverage of your electrical system.  Check with the Germans and Danes about the cost.  Their residential electric total costs are more than twice the average of the US.  They were three times as high before we moved further down the insane road of mandating huge amounts of wind and solar.Wind and solar are also low power and dispersed, chewing up an awful lot of land, serving as eyesores, and requiring both tremendous amounts of wiring to collect the electricity needed to supply a city, and even more high-voltage transmission lines, which are politically very unpopular and require huge lawsuits to get built anywhere.  And both involve huge amounts of toxic materials to manufacture and then pose huge headaches for disposal at the end of their relatively short useful lives.Fossil fuels and nuclear are more economical and far more reliable and controllable.  Global warming exists and rising CO2 is probably adding to it, but the warming trend is a mere 0.14 degrees C (0.25 F) per decade, a ten-year warming you would not notice sitting in a room from one minute to the next.  The science sections of the badly mis-summarized Assessment Reports on climate explicitly state that there is low confidence in any global upward trends in disastrous weather resulting from this moderate warming.  We may not want to keep it up forever, but we easily have decades to find alternative energy sources as economical and reliable as fossil fuels - more likely safer and cheaper future versions of nuclear power.On these grounds, I urge the passage of HB 118.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment!Ralph Mullinger "
Zoeller ,Louisville ,,2022,HB118,Good to pass  to lower energy costs for citizens. 
Barney,"Burnsville, MN",,2022,HB118,"To the honorable men and women of the Virginia legislature. While I am not a resident, I ask that you pass HB 118. Destroying vital land for the placement of solar panels and windmills is folly of the highest order. Even on a perfect day, renewable energy is not capable of supplying the amounts of electricity that is currently being provided, and even with all of the taxpayer subsidies, it certainly isn't cost effective. Electricity rates have been rising just like Mr. Obama pledged they would and the most vulnerable are paying the price. Maybe this was planned so as to get more people dependent on the federal government. Then too, solar panels tend to get hot and therefore kill off valuable insect life such as bees. Wind turbines kill an untold number of birds, including our national symbol, Bald Eagles. Here in MN the energy companies brag about doing flight path studies before placing the turbines, but what they glaringly omit is the fact that they requested and were granted an exemption for killing eagles and other protected species.  Another overlooked but important aspect is the rare earth materials needed to make the socialist energy Nirvana come to pass are located in areas of the world that aren't exactly our best friends. Add to that, the biggest producer of rare minerals China, is building coal fired generating plants a fast as they can, thereby offsetting any potential climate gains we might hope for with so called ""renewable / clean"" energy. With the increasing costs of electricity in this country due to the stupidity of politicians forcing their economy destroying agenda, how can we even think of being competitive on the world manufacturing stage? In other and simpler words, high energy costs mean businesses move away and leave unemployed Americans in their wake. So yeah, if you want to continue to destroy this exceptional nation and the livelihoods of thousands upon thousands of Americans, continue down the clean energy   primrose path."

Troy,Alexandria,,2022,HB118,"HB 118 should be passed to prevent damage that would be done by implementing the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) that was passed last year.  VCEA requires the expenditure of billions of dollars on unreliable solar and wind energy.  Wherever large-scale solar and wind energy projects have been tried (e.g. California, Germany), electric rates have been raised significantly to pay for those projects, but those sources are not reliable.  Existing fossil-fuel, nuclear and hydro power must be maintained to have a reliable source of electricity.   There would be a trivial reduction of carbon dioxide resulting from solar and wind energy in Virginia.  The reduction would be too small to measure.Climate change has been occurring throughout the earth's 4.5-billion year history.  The predictions of climate catastrophe are based on climate models that do not correspond to the actual climate record.Our goal should be to use those sources of energy that best promote human flourishing - fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro.To understand the issue further, please visit  https://energytalkingpoints.comThank you."

Hills,Slidell,The entire world,2022,HB118,"Please pass HB118 as soon as possible.  The Virginia Clean Economy Act is the worst mistake Virginia ever made.  It causes nothing but harm.Facts:1.  The climate is not getting too warm.  In fact, it's too cold!  Massive volcanoes such as Vesuvius spewed so much volcanic ash into the atmosphere that they caused a mini ice age that has never abated..  If the climate were actually getting warmer (which it isn't), it would only be returning to normal.2.  NONE of the dire predictions from the climate alarmists have any truth whatsoever.  Before Vesuvius et al. plunged us into the current mini ice age, polar ice caps didn't melt, coastlines didn't flood, polar bears weren't extinct, and none of the other nightmare scenarios ever happened.  There is absolutely NO reason to expect they would happen this time if the climate DID return to normal.3.  Carbon dioxide (and it's not ""carbon"", that's an entirely different substance) is NOT harmful.  it's what plants make food from.  It is NOT a ""greenhouse gas"", WATER is.  Water absorbs over 99.97% of the sun's energy, but  CO2 can only absorb less than 1/40% of the sun's energy.  Atmospheric CO2 and other so-called ""greenhouse gasses"" aren't even a drop in the ocean compared to H2O,4.  Even if there really was anything we could do about the climate (which there isn't), a warmer climate would actually be beneficial as it would result in increased plant growth, and thus increased food production.   Plants grow faster in a warm environment; that's why gardeners use greenhouses. 5.  Geologic core samples show that the current level of atmospheric CO2 is less than 1/20th of normal.  A rise in CO2 level would only be a return to normal (and would be good for food production).  These same core samples show ABSOLUTELY NO correlation between CO2 levels and climate.  Al Gore's ""doom and gloom"" claims about CO2 levels and climate are a total MYTH.  Al Gore was a politician, not a scientist or engineer.  Don't listen to him - he knows LESS about climate than a pet rock does.  (A pet rock is just a rock.  It knows nothing.  Al Gore's ""knowledge"" about climate is not just wrong, it's FALSE.  Thus he knows LESS than nothing - less than a pet rock!)6.  ""Renewable"" energy sources such as wind and solar are NOT environmentally friendly.  Solar panel manufacture is extremely toxic, using chemicals such as arsenic and sodium hydroxide.  And turbines should really be called ""bird choppers"" because of what they do to birds.  Also, ALL ""renewable"" energy sources use VASTLY more land (which could otherwise be used for better purposes such as farming) than traditional energy sources."

Until the 'renewable' resources are viable on their own without forced taxpayer subsidies, they're not reliable. Demonization of what works before we have something viable to replace it effectively, efficiently and cost effective is insanity. Wind and solar are woefully ineffective, non-recyclable, expensive and environmentally hazardous to humans, wildlife and create an eyesore and maintenance nightmare that their proponents ignore as they gleefully sing its praises, never mind the consequences and astronomical high price both to the public and environment.

Michaels,Fairfax,Former Virginia State Climatologist,2022,HB118,"In support of HB118RGGI IS CLIMATICALLY MEANINGLESS - VIRGINIA SHOULD REPEAL THE VCEAGovernor Glenn Youngkin raised quite a kerfuffle when, even before he took office, he said he would extricate Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). It is the right thing to do.While he's at it, he ought to propose that the Virginia  Legislature repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).To see how unpopular RGGI and the VCEA may be when put into action, the Governor should look across the pond to the UK, which is about to throw out Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose energy policies are making it unaffordable for many Britons to heat their homes. States like Virginia and California are proposing many of them same things that are being executed by Mr. Johnson and by Western Europe (save France). The power shortages caused by heavy reliance on intermittent windmills and remarkably inadvisable solar (the sun is below the horizon half the time) are forcing Germany to burn more coal and to buy tons of natural gas from Russia at high prices, which will then use Germany's ""green"" policies to push that country around politically.Many Germans, like Britons, are also politically restless, and Virginians may be as well. Speaker Todd Gilbert captured  the situation well when he said ""RGGI costs the public significant amounts of money for no tangible benefit"", a conclusion which applies equally to the VCEA. The Democrats were left with nothing to say except prattling on about ""climate change"".For years the US  Environmental Protection Agency has used a computer model called the ""Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) to determine the climactic effect of CO2 reduction proposals. The model predicts that if all US emissions - that is, every CO2 emission (electricity, automobiles, construction, agriculture) - were reduced to zero today ( immediately), the amount of global warming that even this impossible policy would ""save"" is a minuscule 0.13C, which is no more than background noise in the natural variation of climate temperature. RGGI and VCEA are even more futile, as they apply only to Virginia, and only to electricity and automobiles. Their claimed reductions are simply a drop in the bucket, and even if attempted are swamped by China's insistence on burning more coal, and adding more new coal plants than all of Western  Europe combined. As past President of the American Association of State Climatologists, I can confidently say that the vast majority of my former colleagues would agree with me that the climate mitigation underlying RGGI and the VCEA is undetectable.Virginia should reject both of them."
Wrightstone,Arlington,CO2 Coalition,2022,HB118,"Climate change and Virginia - In support of HB 118Statement prepared by Gregory Wrightstone; executive director of the CO2 Coalition based in Arlington. He is a geologist and an expert reviewer for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Below is a summary of a paper prepared by a team of respected experts assembled by the CO2 Coalition. This landmark study reviews the scientific basis for the previous administration’s entry in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). The paper’s principal author is CO2 Coalition senior fellow, Dr. Patrick Michaels who was former Virginia State Climatologist. This paper has been provided to the committee in its entirety for your review. Justifications for Virginia to impose increased regulations and taxation on fossil fuels and fossil fuel-generated energy are based on dire warnings of existing and future CO2-driven catastrophes. Within our paper we assess claims of looming disaster that have been used by former-Governor Northam and supporters of the extensive deployment of expensive and unreliable “renewable” energy sources. We show that assertions of current and future harm from emissions of carbon dioxide are unsupported by the facts.Our finding is that Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is climatically meaningless, as is the overall VCEA program itself. But the costs and inconvenience imposed by VCEA would be economically very meaningful.Rather than increasing as climate alarmists claim, severe weather events have been generally decreasing. In the case of heat waves, there is little dispute that their greatest frequency in both the United States and in Virginia occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. A full 68 percent of all record highs in the state were set in the period 1922 to 1941, and no records have been set in the last 20 years. There is no connection between heat waves and carbon dioxide emissions.In Virginia the sea-level rise is amplified by the well-documented isostatic rebound along the eastern seaboard responding to glacial melt at the end of the last ice advance. Land-subsidence rates in the mid- and northeast Atlantic coastal regions are between two and five mm/year, which yields 21st-century sea level rises of 7.8 to 19.7 inches from non-climatic processes that cannot be arrested. However, despite increasing temperatures, there is no acceleration in the actual rise of sea level according to tide-gauge records.Concerning agricultural decline driven by carbon dioxide-induced climate change, the reality is that Virginia, along with most of the globe, has seen a dramatic increase in crop production over the last several decades. Increased production is consistent with higher levels of carbon dioxide — an essential plant food — and moderate warming, both of which have contributed to an overall greening of Earth.ConclusionUsing EPA’s own “Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change”, If Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (sensitivity of 2.0), a measurement so small as to be meaningless and well below our ability to even measure. The only thing meaningful about the Virginia Clean Economy Act is that it costs consumers and businesses a lot of money by increasing the price of energy.Virginia should follow the science and withdraw from VCEA.

wright,Fairfax,Suburban Virginia Republican Coalition (SUVGOP),2022,HB118,"SUVGOP supports Republican candidates and causes concerning fundamental, kitchen table issues that matter most to Virginians. The SUVGOP newsletter reaches 25,000 subscribers every Monday morning.We support HB 118 - repeal of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).The VCEA is the most radical and partisan piece of legislation regarding energy policy ever codified in Virginia. Like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), it purports to be energy legislation, but in fact is a tax on energy consumption imposed on Virginia  families and businesses which will cost consumers over $2  Billion per year - $800 per year for the average Virginia family. It not only mandates the particular types of energy generation that must be adopted by Virginia's public utilities, but also completely removes any meaningful oversight capability of the State Corporation  Commission (SCC) to determine if such generation modes are affordable and reliable for Virginia consumers.Many Virginians are struggling to pay for their electricity. The Virginia Legislature recently was required to avert a crisis of household electricity termination by requiring Dominion Energy to forgive over $200 million of past due electricity bills. The VCEA's burden on electricity costs will weigh most heavily on low income communities, minority households, and seniors living on fixed incomes.This legislation was based on a questionable premise that has been opposed and refuted by over 31,000 distinguished American scientists, including 801 Virginians, and also by the former State Climatologist, Dr. Patrick Michaels.The VCEA will cause clearcutting and erosion by solar factories placed on vast amounts of Virginia farmland and forests - 770 square miles, 33 times the size of New York City. Now Virginia has the most proposed solar projects in the Country - 450 of them - even though we rank only 24th among all States in the amount of sunshine. The VCEA burdens Virginia with the worst of all worlds: the most unreliable form of energy - solar, which is then coupled with by far the most expensive - offshore wind. Moreover the VCEA obliterates the lynchpin of any sound energy policy - reliability - the dependability which should assure a consistent supply of electricity no matter what kind of weather prevails.As Republicans, we are guided by the words of our new Governor Glenn Youngkin, who consistently said throughout his campaign that ""We need an electrical grid which is stable, and we absolutely have to change direction. We must change direction from the VCEA, because it is not doable, affordable, or good for Virginia"". He also promised to ""reduce the cost of living"" for Virginians.  Repeal of the VCEA is  a key element in fulfilling that goal.All the Governor's pledges are jeopardized by an energy policy which promises ever-spiraling electricity costs, environmental degradation, and danger to reliability. Our vision is that, far from being the supplicant for energy supplied by other States, the Commonwealth of Virginia, by expanding its impressive existing assets - nuclear, natural gas, and others, will become the reliable supplier of energy for the mid-Atlantic region.The VCEA should be repealed, and Virginia should return to its prior energy status.. The Youngkin Administration should be given the opportunity to frame the kind of energy grid which it believes is both affordable and reliable,"

Climate change-related disasters in the US last year cost us some $158 billion, another in a string of years of multibillion-dollar extreme weather disasters. Despite the pandemic, our US emissions went up 6% last year. Currently, it is summer in South America where there is a heatwave of extraordinary characteristics, creating historical records for Argentina temperatures and persistence of heat. I urge you to please listen to the scientists who are asking all of us to ""Look UP"" – so, yes, we really do need to take the climate-extinction crisis seriously.It is sensible now to require certain large public buildings to include solar-ready roofs in new construction or significant renovations, saving energy and taxpayer money when solar is added. A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to net-zero standards recover the added construction cost in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years.  Please support legislation that develops Virginia's renewable energy infrastructure, legislation our children deserve that will give them a chance.Thank you for the good work you do on our behalf,Michael L.

Dunn,Warren County,Skyline Solar,2022,HB724,"Hello,I wanted to speak up and vote yes and/or offer my testimony as to why passing this bill for net metering and specifically aggregated net metering for farms or working agricultural businesses with more than one meter on the property is very important to the growth of clean energy, farms, the solar industry and ultimately our long term sustainable future. When the opportunity for aggregated net metering expired with Rappahannock and I suppose other coop's in the state of Virginia in June/July of 2020, it seriously affected one of my clients as well as our solar business in a negative way. I actually have a very specific case study as our company was in negotiations with our client who owns a farm that has 16 meters on the property. We had done many site visits, consultations, proposals etc., and after much consideration had determined that a large consolidated solar array on the roof of a very large hay barn would help preserve certain areas of his land and integrate all of the solar to one meter as opposed to putting ground mounts and or roof mounted solar in many different locations throughout the farm. This strategy would also help our customer save considerable money on the overall project making it much more viable. We had to scale back on the project size from a potential system size of 152 kw to only 32."
Wofford,"Sperryville, VA",Alliance for the Shenandoah Valley,2022,HB724,"On behalf of Alliance for the Shenandoah Valley, a regional conservation organization based in New Market, Va, I am writing in support of HB 724. In general, working farms have multiple meters. The inability for farmers in co-op territory to aggregate their meters is a barrier to farmers who would to generate their own solar energy and contribute to our transition to renewable energy.  Restoring the ability for farmers to aggregate their meters is a step in the right direction. We also strongly support  the formation of a working group to address concerns of farmers and electric cooperatives to ensure success of the program and to assess other ways that small-scale solar energy projects can meet on-farm energy needs.
