Table 1. provides a general overview of bill trajectories by year
Table 2., a general overview of the trajectories of bills by Sierra Club (or proxy, 2015 and 2016) position.
Tables 3(a) and (b) show in more detail the committees to which bills were referred, by year and by Sierra Club ‘position’.
Table 4. shows the trajectory of the randomized control at the same granularity as Table 1.
Now we move to year by year analysis of bill trajectory, specifying the all-important
committees, in Table 5(a) and (b)(2015); Table 6(a) and (b)(2016); Table 7(a) and (b)(2017);
Table 8(a) and (b)(2018); Table 9(a) and (b)(2019); Table 10(a) and (b)(2020); Table 11(a) and
(b)(2021); and Table 12(a) and (b)(2022). Tables 13 through 20 show line graphs of the (gross)
proportion of bills at each stage of the legislative process for each year (also shown in
dashboard). Tables 21 through 27 show the randomized control groups for each year (which
passed through different committees); 28 through 35 the most controversial control and 36
through 43 the least controversial.
