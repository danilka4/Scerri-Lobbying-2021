                HB 1288 TECHNICAL INTERVENTION 

This bill will allow the State Corporation Commission to set future electricity rates based on the cost of service. Currently  the SCC has arbitrary restrictions to order a decrease in rates even when the cost of providing electricity to customers has decreased. 

Currently,  Customers are paying more than they should for electricity and this bill can fix the problem. For example, Dominion is overcharging customers by 200 million every year, but the current provisions in the code do not allow the commission to decrease rates.  

Let me give you a bit of background 

To establish the rates of all water and gas monopolies in the state the regulator does a forward looking analysis of rates. This analysis  basically determines  what price of water or gas customers should pay for the utility to recover all costs plus a competitive profit. 

If costs in the next three years  will be higher than what current rates are recovering then there is a rate increase. If costs in the next three years will be lower there is a rate decrease. 

The problem in Virginia is that in 2007 and 2018 Dominion and APCO wrote special rules for them that make a rate decrease practically impossible, even when rates are above costs and fair profits.

Under the special rules that only apply for Dominion and APCO there are two conditions before ordering a rate cut:

The first condition is that  the  SCC must do a backward looking analysis of the last three years to see how much money they collected  compared to their costs. Only if the utility overcharged in the last three years the SCC can decrease future rates.  

But then there is a second condition. Dominion can choose to recover the cost of specific projects with the money they overcharged in the past. If  these projects cost is higher than the overcharges the SCC can not decrease rates. Every time, the utility can choose to use the overcharges to pay for  projects with a higher value than overcharges and prevent a rate cut.

This bill will get rid of these two barriers allowing the SCC to set lower rates that reflect  lower costs of service looking forward. This is how all investor owned water and natural gas utilities are currently regulated and it is how APCO and Dominion were regulated before 2007. 

There is no justification to keep these barriers to rate cuts when Dominion has been overcharging customers by at least 200 million dollars every year. Currently, customers are paying more than they should for electricity and this bill can fix the problem.

                Say NO to the bills that take away Collective Bargaining. Employees in the state of VA deserve Collective Bargaining.  Teachers, firefighters and Policeman deserve a position in determining what happens in their profession. For too long they have had to sit back and let others who are not part of their profession, decide what happens in their profession. Give them a voice to determine what  is in the best interest for their profession. Teachers work day and night to provide what is in the best interest of students- no one knows better then they do how to achieve this- they deserve a voice in the decision-making  We will lose the best  teachers, firefighters and policemen if we take away this critical opportunity for them to have a voice  in their professions.  Say NO to the bills that take away Collective Bargaining.

                Good morning honorable members of the Committee,

Massachusetts is often said to have the strongest public schools in the nation.  Did you also know that Massachusetts Educators also have strong collective bargaining rights.  Massachusetts invests in education.  With the current staffing shortages,  show Virginia families and educators that you are in strong support of education by supporting collective bargaining rights.  Virginia educators earn 7k below the national average and many are abandoning the profession.  Can you blame them?

Sincerely

Brian McGovern

                The price of energy affects the poor and working man much more than it does any rich politician or or entitled class.  The idiocy espoused by the Biden administration and the leftist politicians in America is it is not just laughable, it is anti-American and impacts impacts each one of us in a negative way.

                These bills will repeal educators&#39; progress toward gaining collective bargaining. They will silence educators&#39; voices. School decisions will not be able to capitalize on the experiences and skills of their experts in their school systems, the educators. Why deny educators a seat at the table? Why squelch expert input? Educators are the experts in our schools. Bargaining with educators benefits our students&#39; learning conditions. It improves educator working conditions, and ultimately benefits our Virginia communities.

Bring the experts to the table. 

I urge you to vote no on these bills.
Sincerely,

              </p>

                On behalf of the Virginia Grassroots Coalition, I urge you to support HB1288 which would restore critical authority to the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to ensure that energy bills to ratepayers are just and reasonable.  Lowering bills is a kitchen table issue - Virginians pay the 8th highest energy bills in the country.  In the 2021 Dominion rate, the Attorney General and SCC staff demonstrated that Dominion Energy had overcharged ratepayers between $1 and $1.2 billion in excess profits over a 4-year period. SCC authority to refund ratepayers, however, was capped at $50 million.  Please protect Virginians by restoring authority to the SCC to determine fair rates.  Eliminate loopholes that enable Dominion Energy to earn beyond its statutory rate of return at the ratepayers’ expense.

Mammography must be optional, based on the woman&#39;s choice.  For a lot of thinking women it is wrong (does not make sense) to invade breasts with radiation in an effort to &quot;detect&quot; breast cancer.

It is a good idea to carefully define this disorder in the bill.  Make sure NOT to simply repeat psychiatric jargon in the wording of the law, or it will be uninterpretable by the public that is being served. 

At a minimum, provide a clear definition of autism in plain English in the bill.
