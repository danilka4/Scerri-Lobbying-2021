                Please support HB1346 so that localities throughout Virginia have the authority to require the replacement and planting of trees during the development process. The destruction of trees by developers greatly affects the health and quality of life for humans and animals. Preservation of mature trees is vital for climate resilience. We also need to ensure that tree replacements are native species for maximum benefit to our ecosystem.

                The Virginia League of Conservation Voters supports HB520 and HB1346.

Reasons to SUPPORT HB 520:
- HB520 encourages localities to adopt resilience strategies within their comprehensive plans including strategies to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to changing conditions and hazardous events.

- Although current provisions in the Virginia Code currently require some Tidewater localities to include guidance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to foster the sustainability of shoreline resources; and for Hampton Roads Planning District Commission localities to incorporate strategies to combat sea level rise and recurrent flooding, all localities within Virginia are being impacted by stronger storms and subsequent flood events.

- HB 520 is one of a suite of bills proposed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission intended to integrate statewide flooding and resilience planning and implementation across the Commonwealth in a comprehensive manner.

Reasons to SUPPORT HB 1346:
50,000 acres of forest and non-urban tree canopy are converted to other land uses per year in Virginia due to timber harvest, urbanization, agricultural expansion, and other drivers.
These bills are the result of the months’ long stakeholder advisory group representing local government, home builders, commercial builders, agriculture, conservation members and Department of Forestry.
The legislation prioritizes on-site tree preservation and replanting but affords some opportunities to meet canopy requirements in nearby under-resourced communities—including formerly redlined neighborhoods—to help offset urban heat islands. 
The bills also allow larger tree canopies to be required when development occurs in areas with existing enhanced tree canopies or when a locality agrees to a somewhat reduced local parking lot, setbacks, and similar requirements.

                Virginia Loggers Association is a trade association made up of forest harvesting companies, wood products mills, and supporting businesses.

VLA opposes HB 1346.  VLA is concerned that giving localities such a broad authority of tree canopy and related matters was not the intent of previous legislation and now Code of VA 10.1-1126.1 (see below full text).  This Code section prohibits localities from creating ordinances and regulations that limit or restrict legitimate silvicultural activities i.e. forest harvesting and other best management forestry practices necessary for healthy forest stands.

Development is a process which can best be determined by professional staff of localities, project managers, and development staff with skills in forestry, water quality protection, and other environmental issues.  This is best determined on a case by case basis.  General specifications regarding tree canopy, tree replacement, and similar matters are not the answer.

§ 10.1-1126.1. Silvicultural practices; local government authority limited.
A. Forestry, when practiced in accordance with accepted silvicultural best management practices as determined by the State Forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105, constitutes a beneficial and desirable use of the Commonwealth&#39;s forest resources.

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, silvicultural activity, as defined in § 10.1-1181.1, that (i) is conducted in accordance with the silvicultural best management practices developed and enforced by the State Forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105 and (ii) is located on property defined as real estate devoted to forest use under § 58.1-3230 or in a district established pursuant to Chapter 43 (§ 15.2-4300 et seq.) or Chapter 44 (§ 15.2-4400 et seq.) of Title 15.2, shall not be prohibited or unreasonably limited by a local government&#39;s use of its police, planning and zoning powers. Local ordinances and regulations shall not require a permit or impose a fee for such silvicultural activity. Local ordinances and regulations pertaining to such silvicultural activity shall be reasonable and necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens residing in the locality, and shall not be in conflict with the purposes of promoting the growth, continuation and beneficial use of the Commonwealth&#39;s privately owned forest resources. Prior to the adoption of any ordinance or regulation pertaining to silvicultural activity, a locality may consult with, and request a determination from, the State Forester as to whether the ordinance or regulation conflicts with the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude a locality from requiring a review by the zoning administrator, which shall not exceed ten working days, to determine whether a proposed silvicultural activity complies with applicable local zoning requirements.

C. The provisions of this section shall apply to the harvesting of timber, provided that the area on which such harvesting occurs is reforested artificially or naturally in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 11 (§ 10.1-1100 et seq.) of Title 10.1 or is converted to bona fide agricultural or improved pasture use as described in subsection B of § 10.1-1163.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to land that has been rezoned or converted at the request of the owner or previous owner from an agricultural or rural to a residential, commercial or industrial zone or use.

                I support HB 364, 520, and 1276 and would like to add that LAND USE must be part of our conception of &quot;climate resiliency&quot;. Transportation and poor land use account for a lot of climate change, and no serious climate plan can skip over addressing car dependence, sprawl, car culture, lawn culture, and single-use zoning. All this applies to our conception of a &quot;healthy community&quot; too. When more people walk, bike, and take transit to get around, we get healthier communities. Car culture is terrible for public health.
I support HB 1346 and would like to add that there needs to be significant emphasis on NATIVE trees and efforts to root out non-native trees, many of which are actively invasive and ecologically harmful.
I SUPPORT HB 548.

                Please support HB1346 that gives local jurisdiction authority to require replacement and planting of trees during the development process, including an amendment that will grandfather in localities that adopted ordinances prior to 1990. Trees are a crucial community asset, helping to create a unique sense of place. Trees add value to residential properties and bring in more business in commercial districts. Trees help control stormwater runoff, help reduce energy bills, and cool their surrounding environment.

                I support HB 1346.  Please support this bill requiring developers to replace trees taken down during building on new or existing lots.  Better would be to not allow the trees to be destroyed at all.  The loss of trees due to development in Fairfax County is markedly observable in the past decade, leading to a huge loss of diversity of the entire ecosytem.  Please pass this bill and look to ways to incentivize for builders to leave mature trees on their lots during development.

                Please support HB1346 so that localities have the authority to require the replacement and planting of trees during the development process. The destruction of trees by developers greatly affects the health and quality of life for humans and animals.  Localities that are impacted absolutely should have the authority to protect their citizens.

                I support this bill to try to give local jurisdictions the power to require tree replacement and conservation during development. As others have commented, the loss of habitat in one &quot;small&quot; development is catastrophic to the birds, insects, and animals and hastens erosion and runoff. I read the VLA&#39;s comments and would like to say that the status quo is NOT working. Without a change, the depredations will continue. Citizens have a right to a clean and healthy environment and should be able to determine how best to preserve trees in their locality. The lack of ANY effort currently is appalling.

                Please support this bill requiring developers to replace trees taken down during building on new or existing lots.  Tree loss is a scourge that has long lasting impact locally on neighborhoods and cumulatively on our planet.  Reducing the tree canopy in an edge forest or existing pocket forest as in common in our urban landscape, weakens the wind break shelter for other trees in the immediate area; making them prone to blow down if they are already weakened by disease, excessive impermeable surfaces nearby, or overzealous pruning.  Mature native trees like Oak, Willow, Cherry, Tulip Poplar, Beech, Holly--the list goes on and on, provide ecosystem resources--food for fledgling birds, in the form of caterpillars that grown on the trees from deposited moth eggs.  The trees act as heat sinks, cooling areas in summer through transpiration.  The trees reduce  water run off and help filter ground water first through their umbrella leave canopy all the way down to their extensive root system.  The trees use carbon from the atmosphere and build their tissue this way, thereby sucking up our own carbon dioxide pollution and turn it into carbon--wood, and sugar-leaves.  Please pass this bill and look to ways to incentivize for builders to leave mature trees on their lots during development.   To build more background knowledge, if anyone is interested, please read any of these books by Dr. Doug Tallamy, Bringing Nature Home, Nature&#39;s Best Hope or The Nature of Oaks.  Respectfully submitted.  Thank you for your time.

                Our city, state, earth, needs every bit of help it can get!  We have massive developments, where builders and developers are just allowed to slaughter and clear cut beautiful old trees.  It’s horrific.  For example, Brooks place development on sleepy hollow in falls church, slaughtered ten acres of trees!   How can that happen or be permitted?  Can’t they make lots and all have to have trees around them?  Every slaughtered oak hosts over 400 species of moth and butterfly’s.   That’s before you talk the birds they support and the flying squirrels.  Then they provide the leaf litter that supports thousand more critters - mammals, skinks, salamanders, toads, box turtles and all the birds that feed off those small rodent mammals and all those eggs amongst the leaf litter.  Removing a single tree impacts hundreds of wildlife.  This is before we even discuss the value of trees in reducing carbon and protecting earth from water runoff.  Tree value goes on and on.  I would challenge everyone on the committee to read The Nature of Oaks by Doug Tallamy and then not see the need to replace every tree that is removed.   I support tree replacement.  Every removed tree should be required to be replaced with a native tree - whether it’s an over story tree or understory tree.  Let’s not repeat the  Bradford Pear tree disaster.  Replace trees. Replace them with native trees.  Thank you.

                Friends of Accotink Creek SUPPORTS Del.  Bulova&#39;s HB1346 regarding tree canopy.  Due to increased development, many areas in Virginia are losing trees to impervious surfaces.   More impervious surfaces means more stormwater runoff.  One inch of rainfall on an acre of parking produces 27,000 gallons of stormwater. (Source: Penn State Extension). Stormwater runoff is the number one cause of stream erosion in urban and suburban areas. Restoring eroded streams is costly for Virginia taxpayers: The Town of Vienna&#39;s 2nd phase of the Bear Branch stream-restoration project along 2,300 feet of Bear Branch comes to $2.52 million. Fairfax County will pay one half, the state of Virginia the other. That amounts to $1,096 per foot. And that&#39;s just one project! Stormwater runoff also silts up lakes. Dredging lakes, to retain their value as recreational amenities, is extremely costly. Lake Accotink in Fairfax County has a sediment load of some 500 cubic yards and requires a dredging project estimated at $60 million. The work will begin in 2023. If stormwater is not reduced, the lake will need future dredgings.  Stormwater runoff also pollutes our waterways. As it pounds down on paved surfaces, stormwater picks up trash, oil and grease, pet waste, pesticides, lawn fertilizer, road salt, and metals, and carries them into streams.  An important function of trees is to absorb stormwater falling on impervious surfaces. A single mature, deciduous tree intercepts from 500 to 700 gallons of water from rainfall each year. Lawns absorb very little. Delegates of the CC&amp;T Committee, we urge you not to cave to the demands of special interest groups, and allow communities in Virginia burdened with the costs of excessive stormwater to manage their own solutions. Please support HB 1346/ SB537.

                Please support HB1346 so that localities have the power to require the replacement and planting of trees during the development process.   The destruction of trees by developers causes erosion and run-off, lessens the quality of the air we breathe, affects energy bills, diminishes the beauty of neighborhoods, and increasingly leaves wildlife with no place left to go.  Frequently it&#39;s also unnecessary, serving only to lower costs for the developer.  If developers knew they would have to replace trees, maybe they would reconsider antiquated clear-cutting practices.  Please support this bill and let local governments decide about this important issue.

                Each of the four bills (HB 541, 706, 1316, and 1346) deals with tree canopy, tree replacement, conservation, and credits during the development process.

VLA opposes bills which grant authority to localities to dictate certain canopy cover. We fear such restriction might be construed to give localities additional authority to dictate, restrict, or prohibit legitimate silvicultural activities.  We also know of situations where legitimate forest harvesters are perceived to be part of the development and localities have tried to hold them responsible for erosion &amp; sediment regulations.

Forest harvesting is often the first land disturbance activity to occur in development.  Legitimate silviculture is exempt from erosion &amp; sediment rules although subject to the silvicultural water quality law in 10.1-1181.2.

Forest harvesters can inadvertently become involved as part of the development when in fact they are secured only to perform the silvicultural forest harvesting. This incorrect interpretation can result in problems for the innocent.

Localities have access to many experts who can help development project leaders determine best practices for water quality, shade, aesthetics, and control of erosion and sediment movement.  VLA contends it is difficult to arbitrarily set canopy tree cover standards when it should be based on the professional judgements of skilled practitioners.

VLA hopes this may help you to understand the concerns of our members and business owners.  We are happy to discuss and help as needed.

VLA appreciates your leadership on the House Counties, Cities and Towns Committee and the work you do to help your constituents.

                 I SUPPORT Delegate Bulova&#39;s HB1346.   The Dept. of Forestry says that Virginia loses 16,000 acres of trees every year to development and disease.  We need to be planting a lot more to stem this loss. Communities need the authority to protect their tree canopies from rapacious developers who clear cut lots for their own convenience, and do not trouble to replant them. The house next door to us had 15 to 20 mature trees. Now it has only the 2  small ones planted by the builders.  Trees are valuable not only for the ecological services they provide, but for their beauty.  Please prioritize the needs of communities over the profits of developers.

                Please support HB1346, a bill that should enjoy bipartisan support.  Virginia&#39;s tree canopy is suffering, and local communities want to help.  Mature trees preserve water, soil, and carbon, purify the air, provide shade during increasingly long hot summers, and increase residential and commercial property values.  Developers nevertheless often cut down mature trees using the misguided reasoning that buyers prefer clear-cut lots and preserving trees isn&#39;t worth the effort.  When construction is done, developers typically plant a few immature trees which may not even live one year. Please give local governments the authority to evaluate individual lots and projects, and preserve mature trees where appropriate.  Lawmakers in Richmond don&#39;t have the time, skills, or expertise to displace local officials dedicated to beautifying their communities and ensuring good property values through trees.   Thank you.

                Please support HB1346 that gives local jurisdiction authority to require replacement and planting of trees during the development process, including an amendment that will grandfather in localities that adopted ordinances prior to 1990. Trees are a crucial community asset, helping to create a unique sense of place. Trees add value to residential properties and bring in more business in commercial districts. Trees help control stormwater runoff, help reduce energy bills, and cool their surrounding environment.  Trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and provide oxygen via photosynthesis, making them an irreplaceable part of a healthy environment.

                Newport News City Council supports HB1346 and legislation that provides local governments with greater authority in the reforestation, preservation, and management of urban forests in recognition of their ability to capture and store carbon, reduce stormwater runoff, improve air quality, reduce energy use, and mitigate urban heat islands and their health effects.

                Virginia has been losing its tree canopy for many years. We are losing many mature trees every day to developers who clear entire lots of every living thing before they erect a house. When they&#39;re done, they plant a few very young trees, some of which die the first year.  Please give local governments like my town the power to preserve more mature trees. Mature trees clean the air and provide habitat. They beautify our communities and lighten our hearts. Please support HB1346.

                Friends of the Rappahannock supports HB1346. This bill gives localities the option to adopt additional authority to preserve and expand tree canopies following new development or redevelopment. For localities that have existing tree programs, there is no change.

Thank you for your consideration of this important compromise legislation.

                Virginia Loggers Association opposes HB 1346. Developers should work closely with local &amp; state officials to determine the best prescription for individual developments.  Mandates cannot replace careful planning and review of good site planning.
