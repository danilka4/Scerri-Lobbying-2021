                I do not believe the actions proposed by this bill would provide the relief you’re looking for. There are many downsides to destroying farmland and wilderness just to put up a bunch of solar panels and windmills. We still have sufficient oil, gas, and coal and hydroelectric plants that do not pollute the air. Mother Earth would like you to leave her beautiful spaces as they are. Birds don’t like windmills or solar panels either.

                Virginia Legislators:
Please end the foolish VCEA.
VCEA is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.  It will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.  It will hit poorer families the hardest.  It will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.  It will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.  VCEA will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.
Thank you,
              </p>

                Dominion has no plan that complies with VCEA and provides reliable electricity. In their 2020 IRP they said they would have to import up to 10,000 MW in winter because solar was completely unreliable. But then in their 2021 IRP Update they say that imports like this are not feasible because everyone is going solar. The only alternative is huge amounts of storage, hundreds of thousands of MWh, costing hundreds of billions of dollars, but their plan only provides 16,000. It is completely unreliable, beginning next winter.

VCEA simply cannot work. See my article for details:

                This is a comment on HB 118 on the VCEA.

I urge the legislature to modify VCEA so that DEQ and others can audit the review and oversight process for large-scale solar and assess environmental damage from projects already completed or in train, and not to continue blindly down the path of widespread industrial-scale solar. 

Several projects began construction even before DEQ reviewed and approved the submissions, contrary to law, with no subsequent penalty. Moreover, responsibility for assessing a project&#39;s impact on the environment, wildlife, archaeological sites, and watersheds rests solely with developers, per VCEA’s terms, with DEQ providing zero oversight to ensure that developers&#39; submissions are accurate and include meaningful mitigation to environmental problems. Indeed, DEQ approval letters never require developers to actually do anything but merely &quot;urge&quot; them to mitigate potential damage and protect wildlife. Where are the checks in the system to ensure that the process is respected and followed? And why does DEQ not have the authority to compel compliance from developers in advance? 

A very concerning aspect of large-scale solar is its destruction of topsoil, as documented by the American Planning Association, that will prevent land used for solar from being restored to full agricultural or forestry uses after panels are removed, despite solar developers’ claims to the contrary. Solar panels are impermeable surfaces and have created massive runoff problems in every single large-scale project so far, silting up streams and lakes, and flooding (and damaging) neighboring properties, including in Louisa, Mecklenburg, Spotsylvania, and Essex Counties. Much runoff flows directly into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, undermining efforts to protect the bay. Heavy solar development is planned for southside and southwest Virginia, where the resulting runoff will damage the Nottoway, New, Banister, and Roanoke River basins. Yet few developers have been penalized in any meaningful way for their abject failures thus far. Where is the environmental oversight for watershed protection?

Developers must file written plans and post security to defray future decommissioning costs yet are allowed to deduct what they claim are the monetary gains of salvaging or recycling the equipment, often resulting in zero money being posted. Yet recycling of these panels is very labor-intensive, with little demonstrated salvage value, making it unlikely to happen. Who will pay to remove literally millions of panels if developers are allowed to minimize and even eliminate their own financial commitments and cash-poor counties lack the financial resources to cover the costs?

Written decommissioning plans also claim that used panels will be returned to their manufacturers, over 90% of whom are in China, but if those companies no longer exist in 30 years or refuse to accept the panels, where will they end up? Answer: in Virginia landfills, many of which adjoin historically black towns and communities, including at least one Rosenwald school. Where is the environmental justice for them?

Enough projects have been completed to allow us to halt further development and audit every single project to revalidate the process, tighten compliance and enforcement, and provide the oversight needed to protect Virginia’s precious natural resources. True environmental responsibility demands nothing less of Virginia&#39;s General Assembly and State Senate.

RE: Virginia Businesses Support the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Regional Greenhouse Gas Program (RGGI), and Clean Cars 

Dear Chair Byron and Members of the House Commerce and Energy Committee: 

Ceres is a nonprofit organization working with major companies and investors to build economic solutions to climate issues. We write today to share the position of the business community in Virginia on the bills before the Committee that propose to modify the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) as well as Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Advanced Clean Cars (&quot;Clean Cars&quot;) program. Members of Ceres BICEP Network* with operations in Virginia include Adobe, Ball Corporation, IKEA, JLL, Kaiser Permanente, Lyft, Mars Inc., McDonald’s, Microsoft, Nestle, Salesforce, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries. 

As large employers and energy users, businesses understand how Virginia’s energy policy affects the cost of doing business. Maintaining market-friendly climate policies like the VCEA, RGGI and Clean Cars will enable Virginia to make critical progress on pollution and decarbonization while investing in a competitive, resilient economy. The VCEA is an attractive policy for companies looking to power their operations with renewable energy to make investments in Virginia. Energy efficiency and renewable standards keep energy costs low, consistent, and predictable over the long-term, allowing companies to plan ahead. That’s why 97 companies in Virginia have committed to power all of their corporate operations with 100% renewable energy. Continuing to participate in RGGI will ensure that state’s clean energy transition includes critical financial support to vulnerable coastline communities through flood mitigation programs and to vulnerable households statewide through funding for low-income energy efficiency programs. Further, predictable, stable energy policy sends a signal to new businesses that Virginia is a good place to invest. 

On behalf of seven businesses and four higher education institutions, I am pleased to share the attached letter urging the Virginia Legislature to maintain and build upon the considerable progress made in recent years to confront the climate crisis and build a competitive in-state clean energy market. The following companies, Hannon Armstrong, Lutron, Mars, Inc., Nestlé, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries, and higher-ed institutions Sweet Briar College, University of Lynchburg, Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, and Virginia Wesleyan University share their support in the letter for the VCEA, RGGI, and Clean Cars, citing the significant business benefits of these policies, such as lower energy costs, new in-state investments, and programs that will help them meet their own climate goals. The signatories urge legislators to maintain a hospitable environment for clean energy investments going forward. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, and please be in touch with any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Mel Mackin 
Manager, State Policy

                Solar and wind is not environmentally friendly when thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of acres will be destroyed to install the inefficient so-called power producers. Wind turbines kill birds, required massive amounts of concrete. Solar panels in huge installations destroy the homes of small animals and deprive larger animals with food. This does even include the costs to the humans now and in the future.

                Virginia Legislators:
Please end the foolish VCEA.
VCEA is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.  It will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.  This will hit poorer families the hardest.  It will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.  This will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.  VCEA will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.
Respectfully,
              </p>

                Public comments on HB118

HB118 is critical to maintaining competitive electric rates in Virginia, and to maintaining reliable power generated in the Commonwealth.  Key components of the bill repeal Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), and returns power to the State Corporation Committee to protect electric customers from excessive rate increases.  Our analysis shows without HB118 electric rates may rise 60% to 100% by 2030, and the negative impact on the economy could be $10 to $16.5 billion a year.

Virginia’s RGGI carbon tax started in January 2021, and solar power generation more than doubled to 4% of electric demand as the impact of the VCEA kicked in.  Consequently, According to the US Energy Information Agency, ten months of real data shows the fallacies of Virginia’s RGGI carbon tax program when compared to the same ten months in 2020.  In-state electric generation fell 9% as natural gas-fired power plants lost against regional electric grid bids from non-carbon tax states with 10% to 13% lower cost. Virginia generators will lose about $330 million in generation revenue in 2021.  The bottom-line result was residential electric bills would likely rise to $80 per year in just the first year.

The RGGI tax actually increased global emissions by about 390,000 tons as imports have higher emissions after transmission losses, and the generation system mix are considered. Increased solar generation replaced zero-emitting nuclear and hydroelectric power 58% of the time, with the balance of offsets coming from low emission natural gas leading to, at best, 340,000 tons of emission savings.  
So, in reality, there may have been no emissions savings as intermittent solar power usually requires increased backup power from less efficient, fast start oil and natural gas generators. Even if the 14 million ton emission goal for 2030 was met, an EPA calculator shows global temperatures would only fall 0.004° F.

The loss of in-state generation will continue as RGGI allowance prices continue to rise and perhaps double. Importing power adds cost to cover the greater transmission losses and congestion at key transmission sub-stations. Well-paying jobs at the power plants would be lost, which has secondary impacts on the economy. RGGI may have a cumulative direct negative impact on Virginia’s economy of $4.5 to $7.2 billion by 2030, or $10.3 to $16.5 billion if indirect and induced effects are included. Local power plants are needed to maintain voltage stability for reliability, and longer transmission lines could face more likely storm damage and outages.

Dominion Energy provides 80% of Virginia’s electricity and plans to replace natural gas generation with wind, solar, and battery backup power to meet the VCEA state mandates. The utility commission determined that the plan would raise residential electric rates by $800 a year by 2030, with industrial rates rising by millions. 

The residential cost estimate rises to $1,500 a year, adding in needed transmission and distribution line additions to bring wind and solar power from distant locations, using actual residential demand, and removing the utility commission assumption customers in North Carolina will share the cost. Large increases in industrial electric bills would likely lead to companies moving elsewhere taking high-paying jobs with them.

                I am writing to ask that HB118 be passed to eliminate the VCEA legislation. The VCEA will increase my electric bill above an already large part of my monthly fixed income. As a senior, I am reeling from constant price increases from food, cable. phone, and other necessary things to live with. The VCEA will help turn our commonwealth into an ugly landscape loaded with solar farms and windmills, and put our power generation at risk, when there is no need to do so. We cannot allow this landscape destruction to happen. Please pass HB118 and save Virginia&#39;s taxpayers from the VCEA. 
 Thank you.

                We need to use our oil, natural gas, &amp; abundant resources as they are very available &amp; dependable resources. Meanwhile continue development of solar &amp; wind, which hopefully will eventually become more dependable.

              <p class="card-text mt-1"><i class="fad fa-feather commentPoint mr-1"></i>
                I am James Taylor, president of The Heartland Institute. We believe the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act will have a devastating impact on Virginia household incomes while accomplishing very little environmental or climate impact.

For 2021, Virginia was one of the states generating the highest percentage of electricity from conventional energy and the lowest percentage from wind and solar power. This is a primary reason why the average price of electricity in Virginia is currently 18 percent below the national average. 

By comparison, electricity prices in California, which is heavily dependent on wind and solar power, are more than double those of Virginia.

High electricity prices serve as an enormously regressive tax on Virginians.

Virginia can learn a good lesson from the costly experiences of Kansas and Iowa. In 2010, neither state was heavily invested in wind or solar power. The average price of electricity in Iowa in 2010 was 7.66 cents per kilowatt hour. In Kansas, the average price was 8.23 c/kwh. The average price nationally was 9.88c/kwh in 2010. Between the two, the average price of electricity was 7.95 c/kwh, or 20 percent below the national average. 

Now, after ramping up their wind and solar power, the average price of electricity in the two states is 9.92 c/kwh, versus a national average of 11.20 c/kwh. In just over a decade, rather than having electricity priced 20 percent below the national average, the price of electricity in the two states is just 11 percent below the national average. In other words, the price of electricity in Iowa and Kansas is rising 50 percent faster than the rest of the nation.

Virginia will almost certainly suffer the same fate, or a worse fate, under the renewable power mandates in the recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act.

For a Virginia household paying $300 per month in electric bills, a 20-percent increase in electricity prices to reach the national average price would amount to an extra $60 per month – or an extra $720 per year – in household direct electricity bills.  A conservative estimate of the costs that Virginians will pay catching up to national electricity prices would be at least $1,000 per household per year.

The above numbers are merely for Virginians to catch up to the current national average price of electricity, in which merely 12 percent of national electricity is generated by renewable energy sources. The Virginia Clean Economy Act, however, mandates the Virginia economy utilize 100-percent renewable energy, which is much more than current national generation. As such, a conservative estimate of the costs for full implementation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act would be at least $3,000 to $7,000 per household per year.

The United States produces less than 14 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Virginia produces only about 2 percent of U.S. emissions. As such, Virginia accounts for less than 2/10ths of 1 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. The primary motivation for passage of the Virginia Clean Economy Act was carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, yet the Clean Economy Act has an incredibly small impact on global emissions and an impact on global temperatures that is too small to be measured. Imposing $3,000 to $7,000 in higher costs per Virginia household per year is a very steep price to pay to accomplish no measurable impact.

                Dear People,
All the noise being made about climate control and the carbon footprint is just that - noise. Their computer models are built on estimations instead of facts! And, it is a real fact that what this bill seeks to do will do more harm to our people than you have thought about, and absolutely nothing to help the climate. Our people are struggling already, and this is one more silly offer from people to far away from our reality to notice. Fossil fuels are by far the best way for us to heat our homes and transport to work. Please, stop listening to the people who think up this crap in offices but never have to live with their own ideas. If they did, they&#39;d shut up.
Thanks

                I had the privilege to serve as the Virginia State Climatologist from 1980 to 2007, including a term as President of the American Association of State Climatologists. I tender my comments on HB118 after this considerable time in public service.

HB118 mitigates some provisions in the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act, but it does not go far enough.  While I support its passage, I believe that a clean and simple repeal of the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act will ultimately be more in order, because all systematic emissions reductions programs in Virginia are both expensive and climatically futile.

The standard model to assess the climate impact of proposed policies is housed at the Biden Administration’s EPA, and is called the “Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-Gas Induced Climate Change.”

Under standard and common assumptions about future climate change (which themselves may be questionable, likely assuming too much warming), the EPA model calculates that if total US emissions were reduced to zero in the early 21st century, and then kept there until 2100, the amount of global warming that would be prevented from now until then is around 0.13⁰C. But Virginia’s emissions are only about 3% of the US total, which means that nearly a century of zero Virginia emissions would result in a reduction in global warming of approximately 0.004 of a degree (C).

For comparative purposes, China’s emissions are currently about twice those of the US, and they are likely to stabilize around 2030, when they will easily be three times ours. India is also rapidly electrifying via coal-fired generation. In this perspective, the US is rapidly on the way to being a minor player in global carbon dioxide emissions, with a truly negligible contribution from Virginia. By 2030, China’s emissions alone will climatically swamp any US reductions every year.

While I think HB118 should pass the House of Delegates, it may have a difficult time in the Senate.  A cleaner future Bill, in what is likely to be a very different political climate (both Houses of the General Assembly are likely to be Republican), would be a simple repeal of the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act in the 2024 legislative session, which will then be signed into law by Governor Youngkin. Passing HB118 is a first step in this direction, despite its uncertain future in this Session.

                Virginia Legislators:
Please end the foolish VCEA.
VCEA is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.  It will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.  It ill hit poorer families the hardest.  It will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.  It will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.  VCEA will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

                The Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) is clearly the most radical and wasteful energy and climate legislation ever passed in the history of our Commonwealth.  It will most direly impact Virginia&#39;s poorer families, since it will cost Virginia families and businesses a ridiculous $2 billion per year -- which works out to $800 annually for a family of four!  And, it requires the destruction of 770 square miles of farmlands and forests, which is over 30 times the size of New York City.

While seeming to be noble and full of great potential, solar and wind energy have proven time and time again to be unreliable and intermittent when most needed, causing grid destabilization and blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

Virginia needs to act wisely and learn from these mistakes.

I strongly urge the passage of HB118, to roll back the dangerous statewide Green New Deal initiatives.

                Regarding HB 118, renewable energy projects need to be subject to full-blown environmental reviews.  They should not be exempt from any related regulatory or public involvement processes.  

Environmental reviews of renewable energy projects should include an assessment of whether the project would impact the critical habitat of Federally listed endangered species, or potentially result in a prohibited taking of these species.  There are many such species listed in Virginia.  

In addition, environmental reviews  of solar projects must include an assessment of the impacts of erosion that may result from clearing land for solar farms, resulting in increased stormwater runoff carrying sediment that may harm the water quality of streams, lakes, and the Chesapeake Bay, and smother associated fish and wildlife aquatic habitat.

The environmentally damaging procedural flaws in VCEA require that it be repealed.

                Think carefully about this energy bill.  You don&#39;t want to end up like Germany.  Shutting down working nuclear power plants and then trying to make do with solar panels in a climate that is not suitable for them.  (Cloudy days and snow.) 

Wind energy requires an enormous investment in battery technology and takes up large swaths of land while killing large numbers of birds.  At the same time, Germany is also becoming dependent on Russia for natural gas, which is going to cost them in the long run.  Let the free market determine what works.

                Green energy should be left to succeed on it&#39;s own merits and not forced upon a population ill suited to adapt. Like petroleum replaced whale oil and other things evolved over time.  in truth I suspect this is driven more by patronage and favor than by any real concern. There are huge amounts of money at stake and the welfare of the general population will be sacrificed in the process without regard.  Practical thinking must prevail.  Do any of the politicians in favor of this course of action realize that they may still be in office when the devastating effects take place ? They should have to answer for themselves.  The foresight they claim is only for their benefit.

                I see there is a bill, HB 118, to repeal and replace the misbegotten Virginia Clean Economy Act.  I urge you to pass it.

&quot;Clean&quot; energy is extremely expensive and wasteful energy, and not even particularly clean.  Solar and wind are intermittent, cutting out or falling sharply when the wind blows too weakly or strongly, or when clouds block the Sun.  They cannot provide the reliable baseload power a modern economy needs in order to operate.  Batteries are low power and expensive.  Hence, the backup for the intermittent windmills and solar panels is usually fossil fuels, but consumed in wasteful stop/start mode instead of efficient baseload mode.  This means essentially paying for double coverage of your electrical system.  Check with the Germans and Danes about the cost.  Their residential electric total costs are more than twice the average of the US.  They were three times as high before we moved further down the insane road of mandating huge amounts of wind and solar.

Wind and solar are also low power and dispersed, chewing up an awful lot of land, serving as eyesores, and requiring both tremendous amounts of wiring to collect the electricity needed to supply a city, and even more high-voltage transmission lines, which are politically very unpopular and require huge lawsuits to get built anywhere.  And both involve huge amounts of toxic materials to manufacture and then pose huge headaches for disposal at the end of their relatively short useful lives.

Fossil fuels and nuclear are more economical and far more reliable and controllable.  Global warming exists and rising CO2 is probably adding to it, but the warming trend is a mere 0.14 degrees C (0.25 F) per decade, a ten-year warming you would not notice sitting in a room from one minute to the next.  The science sections of the badly mis-summarized Assessment Reports on climate explicitly state that there is low confidence in any global upward trends in disastrous weather resulting from this moderate warming.  We may not want to keep it up forever, but we easily have decades to find alternative energy sources as economical and reliable as fossil fuels - more likely safer and cheaper future versions of nuclear power.

On these grounds, I urge the passage of HB 118.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment!

                To the honorable men and women of the Virginia legislature. While I am not a resident, I ask that you pass HB 118. Destroying vital land for the placement of solar panels and windmills is folly of the highest order. Even on a perfect day, renewable energy is not capable of supplying the amounts of electricity that is currently being provided, and even with all of the taxpayer subsidies, it certainly isn&#39;t cost effective. Electricity rates have been rising just like Mr. Obama pledged they would and the most vulnerable are paying the price. Maybe this was planned so as to get more people dependent on the federal government. 

Then too, solar panels tend to get hot and therefore kill off valuable insect life such as bees. Wind turbines kill an untold number of birds, including our national symbol, Bald Eagles. Here in MN the energy companies brag about doing flight path studies before placing the turbines, but what they glaringly omit is the fact that they requested and were granted an exemption for killing eagles and other protected species. 

 Another overlooked but important aspect is the rare earth materials needed to make the socialist energy Nirvana come to pass are located in areas of the world that aren&#39;t exactly our best friends. Add to that, the biggest producer of rare minerals China, is building coal fired generating plants a fast as they can, thereby offsetting any potential climate gains we might hope for with so called &quot;renewable / clean&quot; energy. 

With the increasing costs of electricity in this country due to the stupidity of politicians forcing their economy destroying agenda, how can we even think of being competitive on the world manufacturing stage? In other and simpler words, high energy costs mean businesses move away and leave unemployed Americans in their wake. So yeah, if you want to continue to destroy this exceptional nation and the livelihoods of thousands upon thousands of Americans, continue down the clean energy   primrose path.

                We need to think over Virginias Energy Policy. Currently, legislation allows 700+ acres of farm and woodland to be destroyed to make way for solar and wind farms. Renewable energy is not efficient or reliable. Additionally, it is not environmentally friendly. Wind farms destroy counless numbers of birds. Additionally windmills destroy the viewshed of the farms and mountains of this beautiful state. Plus---WHY , if you want clean, safe, reliable and cheap energy, why isn&#39;t there a plan to build new reactors?

                HB 118 should be passed to prevent damage that would be done by implementing the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) that was passed last year.  

VCEA requires the expenditure of billions of dollars on unreliable solar and wind energy.  Wherever large-scale solar and wind energy projects have been tried (e.g. California, Germany), electric rates have been raised significantly to pay for those projects, but those sources are not reliable.  Existing fossil-fuel, nuclear and hydro power must be maintained to have a reliable source of electricity.   

There would be a trivial reduction of carbon dioxide resulting from solar and wind energy in Virginia.  The reduction would be too small to measure.

Climate change has been occurring throughout the earth&#39;s 4.5-billion year history.  The predictions of climate catastrophe are based on climate models that do not correspond to the actual climate record.

Our goal should be to use those sources of energy that best promote human flourishing - fossil fuels, nuclear and hydro.

                Sir/Madam:  Though not a resident of your state, I highly encourage you vote for a bill that  would lift the heavy hand of government from Virginia&#39;s electricity generation, and make the grid more reliable, and lower prices for everyone.  Thank you!
Windmills will not do it, and they are actually a danger to the environment and terribly expensive, raising the cost of electricity!

                100 percent renewable energy is impossible. Much money will be wasted in this foolish endeavor. We will always need reliable backup supply. If you want &quot;clean&quot; energy then embrace Nuclear.

                As a citizen of North Carolina I am asking that this piece of legislation should not be passed. When you ruin your state everybody starts leaving. They come here and start ruining my state. I also like Virginia the way it is. Its nice to drive through when I have to travel north. I like the scenery which is beautiful. These wind farms only last a few years, maybe because they are built of Chinese parts and Chinese steel, and wind up as rusted twisted derelicts after a hurricane blows through. It&#39;s bad enough when I have to drive through Baltimore and New Jersey. Don&#39;t extend the ugly scenery any farther south.

                I am not a full time resident of Virginia, however, I do regularly visit, and I am writing in favor of this new bill. My family and I have enjoyed the coast, the island of Chincoteague, Williamsburg, and the western mountains on our numerous trips to Virginia. It seems to me that as a state you would be cutting off your nose to spite your face if you let the present law stand. I certainly would not be coming to see the windmill and solar farms that are not a pretty sight; rather I would much prefer to come and see the beautiful natural spaces for which Virginia is known and loved.  Wait for the technology to advance enough to make it possible to for wind and solar to be viable energy sources, and in the meantime, do not destroy the wonders that draw so many of us to Virginia.

                RE:  HB118

 The Virginia &quot;Clean&quot; Economy Act is a dangerous mistake.  Methods for employing renewable energy need to be developed and improved systematically over time as technology permits, and not be forced upon the masses before their time.  If not, overemployment of renewable energy will turn out to be a failure and a destructive disaster for all of us.

                Dear Legislators,
Virginia &quot;Clean&quot; Economy Act is a dangerous mistake no one can afford.

VCEA is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.

Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.

Will hit poorer families the hardest.

Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.

Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

I hope you will consider the effects of this dangerous bill and choose not to pass it.
Best Regards,
Neal Ala

                I am against the taking of 770 square miles of Virginia farm and forest land for ridiculously expensive and unreliable solar and wind farms.  While politicians brag about how wonderful these farms are, they completely ignore the huge amount of pollution from rare earth mining and refining taking place to build the infrastructure, and again the huge amount of pollution caused by trying to recycle the wind turbines and solar panels after their relatively short lifespan. Politicians ignore the citizens who will be stuck paying higher energy bills for less dependable energy. I have read that a family of four will see their energy bill increase $800 a year to pay for this senseless attempt to control the earth&#39;s climate based on biased hand-picked data.

                They did this to us in Texas (and are still doing it) You saw the results last winter. It killed quite a few people to include a ten year old boy who froze in his house in South Texas. Are you stupid? The green energy programs do not work. From an engineering perspective, (you know - numbers/calculations) Wind and solar panels are only capable of producing about 30% of what the promoters say they do. It is physically impossible. It only works with government money. Do not pass this bill.

                HB 118 ;  Mandating clean energy sources harms more than it helps.  It is an unreliable source of energy, destroys farmland and hurts the consumer as it raises costs on everything.  It makes such an insignificant change to CO  emissions.  Besides, plants thrive on it.

                The price of energy affects the poor and working man much more than it does any rich politician or or entitled class.  The idiocy espoused by the Biden administration and the leftist politicians in America is it is not just laughable, it is anti-American and impacts impacts each one of us in a negative way.

Stop the spread of communism in our country.  Put America First.  Let us together make America Great Again.

                Not one, wind or solar, are self sufficient without subsidies! It cause the price per kilowatt to rise plus with subsidies your paying at least twice the amount for kilowatt than a gas plant or coal or nuclear! To build these units is proven more harmful to the environment from pollution to killing birds and animals! These lies about global warming needs to quit now! You politicians are killing this country, just look at how many you killed with a vaccine, especially kids!

                Virginia &quot;Clean&quot; Economy Act is a dangerous mistake no one can afford. A terrible waste of taxpayer dollars and will only add unstable electricity to the grid which will still need power stations we currently have. Not a plausible idea - might as well throw all that money in a pit - or here&#39;s an idea - use it to put in compact and safe small nuclear reactors....

                End VCEA

The goal to reduce the Commonwealth’s carbon emissions to zero by 2045 and would achieve its ends by bulldozing large amounts of farmland and wilderness to foist the construction of massive new solar and windfarms.

VCEA:
 
    Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.

    Will hit poorer families the hardest.

    Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.

    Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

    Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

Support HB 118 to lift the heavy hand of government from Virginia&#39;s electricity generation, protect the environment, make the grid more reliable, and lower prices for everyone.

Thank You

Watching politicians talk about science is about like watching monkeys have sexual relations with a football. To believe that CO2  is a poisonous gas or that it is bad for the environment is simply ignorant. Without CO2 green vegetation would die and so would most life on earth. This preoccupation with CO2 is a distraction from curbing serious pollution in the world.

                So many high-level political policies, mandates, and acts are being predicated on lies, misconceptions and &#39;elites&#39; ill-conceived agendas. House Bill 118 seeks to roll back one such policy and I support it. The truth is CO2 is not a poison but necessary for life on earth and without it we&#39;d all be dead. Are humans creating too much of it? No, not possible. The best we can do is 4% of the world&#39;s CO2 production and when only one volcano burps it nullifies even the 4% humans at best can take credit for. Former President Reagan once expressed that, &quot;...Freedom is a fragile thing...and it comes only once to a people.&quot; The elites, evil powers of this world, and the Democrat party want to take it away from us and rule America with power and control over everything we do, everywhere we go and anything we want to become. False environmentalism, Covid19, and lies upon lies are their tools that they implore. It&#39;s time for a whole hell of a lot of pushback and the HB118 does that and I support it.

                The Virginia Clean Energy Act is a disaster that does nothing to combat climate change but will result in a large cost to all Virginians and especially the most needy families. This experiment has been tried in the UK and other places and has been a total disaster. We need to continue to utilize our fossil fuel resources and let these so called green initiatives develop as they become cost effective. I as a taxpayer should not have to pay to speed them along.

                When are we going to elect people that ACTUALLY go  by REAL science before imposing their ridiculous and insane ideas on everyone else?  We are constantly told to &#39;follow the science&#39; - yet, those telling us to &#39;follow the science&#39; don&#39;t even know what &#39;science&#39; is - they only know what gibberish they are fed by people with an &#39;agenda&#39; instead of actually doing their own research.

                 Please pass this Bill to remove the yoke of government from the Electrical Industry.

Legislators in Virginia should note that VCEA:

Is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.

Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.

Will hit poorer families the hardest.

Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.

Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100

If this Bill is enacted it may reverberate in other State Legislatures (e.g., RI).

                The goal was to reduce the Commonwealth’s carbon emissions to zero by 2045 and would achieve its ends by bulldozing large amounts of farmland and wilderness to foist the construction of massive new solar and windfarms....cluttering the landscape with junk and putting an even greater strain on existing land/resources. Global Warming in nothing but a hoax, the &#39;climate&#39; is constantly changing, and nothing man can do will alleviate this. 
Remember back in the 80s, these same &#39;scientists&#39; were screaming from the rooftops that were headed for another Ice Age!

                Please pass HB118 as soon as possible.  The Virginia Clean Economy Act is the worst mistake Virginia ever made.  It causes nothing but harm.
Facts:
1.  The climate is not getting too warm.  In fact, it&#39;s too cold!  Massive volcanoes such as Vesuvius spewed so much volcanic ash into the atmosphere that they caused a mini ice age that has never abated..  If the climate were actually getting warmer (which it isn&#39;t), it would only be returning to normal.
2.  NONE of the dire predictions from the climate alarmists have any truth whatsoever.  Before Vesuvius et al. plunged us into the current mini ice age, polar ice caps didn&#39;t melt, coastlines didn&#39;t flood, polar bears weren&#39;t extinct, and none of the other nightmare scenarios ever happened.  There is absolutely NO reason to expect they would happen this time if the climate DID return to normal.
3.  Carbon dioxide (and it&#39;s not &quot;carbon&quot;, that&#39;s an entirely different substance) is NOT harmful.  it&#39;s what plants make food from.  It is NOT a &quot;greenhouse gas&quot;, WATER is.  Water absorbs over 99.97% of the sun&#39;s energy, but  CO2 can only absorb less than 1/40% of the sun&#39;s energy.  Atmospheric CO2 and other so-called &quot;greenhouse gasses&quot; aren&#39;t even a drop in the ocean compared to H2O,
4.  Even if there really was anything we could do about the climate (which there isn&#39;t), a warmer climate would actually be beneficial as it would result in increased plant growth, and thus increased food production.   Plants grow faster in a warm environment; that&#39;s why gardeners use greenhouses. 
5.  Geologic core samples show that the current level of atmospheric CO2 is less than 1/20th of normal.  A rise in CO2 level would only be a return to normal (and would be good for food production).  These same core samples show ABSOLUTELY NO correlation between CO2 levels and climate.  Al Gore&#39;s &quot;doom and gloom&quot; claims about CO2 levels and climate are a total MYTH.  Al Gore was a politician, not a scientist or engineer.  Don&#39;t listen to him - he knows LESS about climate than a pet rock does.  (A pet rock is just a rock.  It knows nothing.  Al Gore&#39;s &quot;knowledge&quot; about climate is not just wrong, it&#39;s FALSE.  Thus he knows LESS than nothing - less than a pet rock!)
6.  &quot;Renewable&quot; energy sources such as wind and solar are NOT environmentally friendly.  Solar panel manufacture is extremely toxic, using chemicals such as arsenic and sodium hydroxide.  And turbines should really be called &quot;bird choppers&quot; because of what they do to birds.  Also, ALL &quot;renewable&quot; energy sources use VASTLY more land (which could otherwise be used for better purposes such as farming) than traditional energy sources.

                Ottawa, Canada is following Germany’s Failed Climate Goals. The city’s government has learned very little from others that have inflicted huge costs for electricity onto their citizens.

As the City of Ottawa pursues electrification of it grid from breezes and sunshine, and electrification of its vehicles, at any cost, it remains oblivious to the real world needs of its most vulnerable citizens to put their plans in place to achieve its “net-zero by 2050 target, regardless of its impact on the lifestyles of its citizens.

                The are only three viable forms of &quot;green energy&quot;: geothermal, hydro and nuclear.  Of the three, Small Modular Reactors (SMD&#39;s) are the only practical way to provide electrical energy in the near and middle term.  Solar and Wind are far too wasteful (areas of land required) and polluting (end of life decommissioning) and require far too many subsidies.  SMD&#39;s do require significant up-front costs but have far longer productive lifetimes and can be scaled to meet local needs without consuming large tracts of land.  Far, far fewer waste products are a result as well as much, much higher efficiencies.  Please review information on SMD&#39;s and kill HB118 for the sake of Earth&#39;s future.

                Everywhere in the world that government has pursued efficient fossil fuel energy sources and forced people into wind and solar -- prices have risen, the environment suffers, and reliability is destroyed. VCEA will hit poorer families the hardest.  

VCEA will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, and other countries.

                Reject HB118. There&#39;s a saying, &quot;Protect Farmland; pavement is forever&quot;. Clean energy is a pipe dream in the sense of replacing what works with &#39;wind or solar&#39; at the expense of food productive farms, so the so-called evil &#39;fossil fuels&#39; are the savior of a society that needs this vital energy source along with nuclear and hydroelectric; to do otherwise is akin to putting us back to the dark ages. Until the &#39;renewable&#39; resources are viable on their own without forced taxpayer subsidies, they&#39;re not reliable. Demonization of what works before we have something viable to replace it effectively, efficiently and cost effective is insanity. Wind and solar are woefully ineffective, non-recyclable, expensive and environmentally hazardous to humans, wildlife and create an eyesore and maintenance nightmare that their proponents ignore as they gleefully sing its praises, never mind the consequences and astronomical high price both to the public and environment. In other words as a good book goes on to detail, wind and solar are &quot;Dumb Energy&quot;.

                &quot;Clean&quot; renewable energy will come as the technology matures and becomes competitive.  America is a great example of reducing emissions without draconian measures.  Artificial deadlines and increased energy costs are not the fair or proper way to a &quot;Green New World.&quot;  Even looking at the supposed benefits of draconian steps that will hurt economies across the planet, the effect on global temperatures is not sufficient anyway.  Trashing our economic system thus does not make sense.  A more gradual economically driven shift does.

demonstrated by any measurements. The threats of global warming are empty, as seen by the facts--our globe is cooling down. Please get facts from both sides of the issue.

                The VCEA:

Is the most radical energy and climate legislation ever passed in the Commonwealth’s history.

Will cost Virginia families and businesses a whopping $2 Billion per year – which amounts to $800 annually for a family of four.

Will hit poorer families the hardest.

Will cause the harmful destruction of farmlands and forests – a whopping 770 square miles, which is 33 times the size of New York City.

Will destabilize the grid by relying on intermittent, unreliable solar and wind energy that has led to blackouts in Texas, California, Europe, and Australia.

Will do nothing to impact climate change as even EPA modeling shows if Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021 degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

                In support of HB118. RGGI IS CLIMATICALLY MEANINGLESS - VIRGINIA SHOULD EXIT RGGI AND REPEAL THE VCEA. As author of books, studies and articles on these issues for 45 years, I can say with confidence that wind, solar and battery facilities are clean, renewable and sustainable IN VIRGINIA only if their cropland, habitat, scenic, wildlife, human health and other impacts are ignored. But this is a GLOBAL issue. These technologies require extensive mining, fossil fuel use, emissions and environmental impacts in foreign countries that provide the necessary raw materials and manufacturing. Offshore turbines require 14 times more materials per MW than combined-cycle gas turbines; solar panels and backup batteries also require massive amounts. VCEA offshore wind turbines alone will need 20,000 tons of copper, which means mining and processing 4,500,000 tons of copper ore, after removing 7,000,000 tons of overburden. One 3-MW onshore turbine foundation uses 1,500 tons of concrete plus rebar. These technologies also require huge amounts of steel, aluminum, lithium, cobalt, rare earth metals, plastics and other materials – and so mining, processing and manufacturing, mostly in China or by Chinese companies in other countries, using fossil fuels and under pollution control, reclamation, workplace safety, and child/slave labor rules far below US standards. Onshore wind turbines, solar panels and battery modules have 15 or 20-year life spans; offshore turbines far less than that, due to salt corrosion. Virginians need answers to questions never raised regarding the RGGI and VCEA. How much electricity will these VCEA-mandated facilities actually generate daily? annually? Who gets to decide where they go? under what environmental reviews and safeguards? How many could be destroyed in a hurricane, tornado or ice storm? How long will it take to repair or replace them? Where will electricity come from in the meantime? Since most components cannot be recycled, where will worn-out and wrecked turbines, turbine blades, solar panels, batteries and concrete foundations be disposed of? How much will repairs, replacement, removal and landfilling cost? Who pays? How will wildlife habitats, raptors, bats, and other endangered species be protected as these industrial-scale installations proliferate? What fines and penalties will be assessed for violations? How many tons of metals, minerals and other materials will be required to build all these “clean economy” facilities? How many tons of ore will have to be mined? Where? How much coal, oil, diesel and natural gas will be required? How much land? Will Virginia insist that more mining be done in the US, so that we are not dependent on China, Russia and other unfriendly foreign sources? How many African, Asian and Latin American children and parents will work in the mines, processing plants and factories that provide these VCEA technologies? How will Virginia ensure workplace health and safety, fair living wages and human rights for them? The VCEA will do nothing to address “dangerous manmade climate change.” (a) All these overseas operations will emit enormous amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. (b) Under the RGGI and VCEA, Virginia will shutter 6,000 megawatts of coal-based electricity, while China alone will soon have 200 times that amount just in coal-fired generation AND is building coal and gas power plants in Asia and Africa. Virginians will pay high energy bills for unreliable energy and no benefits.

                In support of HB118

RGGI IS CLIMATICALLY MEANINGLESS - VIRGINIA SHOULD REPEAL THE VCEA

Governor Glenn Youngkin raised quite a kerfuffle when, even before he took office, he said he would extricate Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). It is the right thing to do.

While he&#39;s at it, he ought to propose that the Virginia  Legislature repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).

To see how unpopular RGGI and the VCEA may be when put into action, the Governor should look across the pond to the UK, which is about to throw out Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose energy policies are making it unaffordable for many Britons to heat their homes. States like Virginia and California are proposing many of them same things that are being executed by Mr. Johnson and by Western Europe (save France). The power shortages caused by heavy reliance on intermittent windmills and remarkably inadvisable solar (the sun is below the horizon half the time) are forcing Germany to burn more coal and to buy tons of natural gas from Russia at high prices, which will then use Germany&#39;s &quot;green&quot; policies to push that country around politically.

Many Germans, like Britons, are also politically restless, and Virginians may be as well. Speaker Todd Gilbert captured  the situation well when he said &quot;RGGI costs the public significant amounts of money for no tangible benefit&quot;, a conclusion which applies equally to the VCEA. The Democrats were left with nothing to say except prattling on about &quot;climate change&quot;.

For years the US  Environmental Protection Agency has used a computer model called the &quot;Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) to determine the climactic effect of CO2 reduction proposals. The model predicts that if all US emissions - that is, every CO2 emission (electricity, automobiles, construction, agriculture) - were reduced to zero today ( immediately), the amount of global warming that even this impossible policy would &quot;save&quot; is a minuscule 0.13C, which is no more than background noise in the natural variation of climate temperature. RGGI and VCEA are even more futile, as they apply only to Virginia, and only to electricity and automobiles. Their claimed reductions are simply a drop in the bucket, and even if attempted are swamped by China&#39;s insistence on burning more coal, and adding more new coal plants than all of Western  Europe combined.
 As past President of the American Association of State Climatologists, I can confidently say that the vast majority of my former colleagues would agree with me that the climate mitigation underlying RGGI and the VCEA is undetectable.

Virginia should reject both of them.

                Climate change and Virginia - In support of HB 118

Statement prepared by Gregory Wrightstone; executive director of the CO2 Coalition based in Arlington. He is a geologist and an expert reviewer for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Below is a summary of a paper prepared by a team of respected experts assembled by the CO2 Coalition. This landmark study reviews the scientific basis for the previous administration’s entry in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). The paper’s principal author is CO2 Coalition senior fellow, Dr. Patrick Michaels who was former Virginia State Climatologist. This paper has been provided to the committee in its entirety for your review. 

Justifications for Virginia to impose increased regulations and taxation on fossil fuels and fossil fuel-generated energy are based on dire warnings of existing and future CO2-driven catastrophes. Within our paper we assess claims of looming disaster that have been used by former-Governor Northam and supporters of the extensive deployment of expensive and unreliable “renewable” energy sources. We show that assertions of current and future harm from emissions of carbon dioxide are unsupported by the facts.

Our finding is that Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is climatically meaningless, as is the overall VCEA program itself. But the costs and inconvenience imposed by VCEA would be economically very meaningful.

Rather than increasing as climate alarmists claim, severe weather events have been generally decreasing. In the case of heat waves, there is little dispute that their greatest frequency in both the United States and in Virginia occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. A full 68 percent of all record highs in the state were set in the period 1922 to 1941, and no records have been set in the last 20 years. There is no connection between heat waves and carbon dioxide emissions.

In Virginia the sea-level rise is amplified by the well-documented isostatic rebound along the eastern seaboard responding to glacial melt at the end of the last ice advance. Land-subsidence rates in the mid- and northeast Atlantic coastal regions are between two and five mm/year, which yields 21st-century sea level rises of 7.8 to 19.7 inches from non-climatic processes that cannot be arrested. However, despite increasing temperatures, there is no acceleration in the actual rise of sea level according to tide-gauge records.

Concerning agricultural decline driven by carbon dioxide-induced climate change, the reality is that Virginia, along with most of the globe, has seen a dramatic increase in crop production over the last several decades. Increased production is consistent with higher levels of carbon dioxide — an essential plant food — and moderate warming, both of which have contributed to an overall greening of Earth.

Conclusion

Using EPA’s own “Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change”, If Virginia were to eliminate 100% of its carbon dioxide emissions, it would only reduce temperature by 0.0021degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (sensitivity of 2.0), a measurement so small as to be meaningless and well below our ability to even measure. The only thing meaningful about the Virginia Clean Economy Act is that it costs consumers and businesses a lot of money by increasing the price of energy.

Virginia should follow the science and withdraw from VCEA.

                HB 225 -- 

It is a good idea to carefully define this disorder in the bill.  Make sure NOT to simply repeat psychiatric jargon in the wording of the law, or it will be uninterpretable by the public that is being served. 

At a minimum, provide a clear definition of autism in plain English in the bill.

                SUVGOP supports Republican candidates and causes concerning fundamental, kitchen table issues that matter most to Virginians. The SUVGOP newsletter reaches 25,000 subscribers every Monday morning.

We support HB 118 - repeal of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).

The VCEA is the most radical and partisan piece of legislation regarding energy policy ever codified in Virginia. Like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), it purports to be energy legislation, but in fact is a tax on energy consumption imposed on Virginia  families and businesses which will cost consumers over $2  Billion per year - $800 per year for the average Virginia family. It not only mandates the particular types of energy generation that must be adopted by Virginia&#39;s public utilities, but also completely removes any meaningful oversight capability of the State Corporation  Commission (SCC) to determine if such generation modes are affordable and reliable for Virginia consumers.

Many Virginians are struggling to pay for their electricity. The Virginia Legislature recently was required to avert a crisis of household electricity termination by requiring Dominion Energy to forgive over $200 million of past due electricity bills. The VCEA&#39;s burden on electricity costs will weigh most heavily on low income communities, minority households, and seniors living on fixed incomes.

This legislation was based on a questionable premise that has been opposed and refuted by over 31,000 distinguished American scientists, including 801 Virginians, and also by the former State Climatologist, Dr. Patrick Michaels.The VCEA will cause clearcutting and erosion by solar factories placed on vast amounts of Virginia farmland and forests - 770 square miles, 33 times the size of New York City. Now Virginia has the most proposed solar projects in the Country - 450 of them - even though we rank only 24th among all States in the amount of sunshine. The VCEA burdens Virginia with the worst of all worlds: the most unreliable form of energy - solar, which is then coupled with by far the most expensive - offshore wind. Moreover the VCEA obliterates the lynchpin of any sound energy policy - reliability - the dependability which should assure a consistent supply of electricity no matter what kind of weather prevails.

As Republicans, we are guided by the words of our new Governor Glenn Youngkin, who consistently said throughout his campaign that &quot;We need an electrical grid which is stable, and we absolutely have to change direction. We must change direction from the VCEA, because it is not doable, affordable, or good for Virginia&quot;. He also promised to &quot;reduce the cost of living&quot; for Virginians.  Repeal of the VCEA is  a key element in fulfilling that goal.

All the Governor&#39;s pledges are jeopardized by an energy policy which promises ever-spiraling electricity costs, environmental degradation, and danger to reliability. Our vision is that, far from being the supplicant for energy supplied by other States, the Commonwealth of Virginia, by expanding its impressive existing assets - nuclear, natural gas, and others, will become the reliable supplier of energy for the mid-Atlantic region.

The VCEA should be repealed, and Virginia should return to its prior energy status.. The Youngkin Administration should be given the opportunity to frame the kind of energy grid which it believes is both affordable and reliable,

                Since the time the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) was enacted in 2020, the premises underlying this ill-conceived, poorly crafted legislation have been suspect. The VCEA was founded upon highly questionable scientific claims. It was rammed through the Virginia legislature without adequate consideration of its economic costs and demonstrable harm to Virginia’s forests and farmland.

Right now there are 440 solar projects in 70 counties pending governmental and regulatory approval. If all these projects are constructed to help meet Green energy pledges, they would cover an area of 778 square miles, equal to 330,00 football fields, 35 times the size of New York City, larger than Albemarle County, and 1.5 times the size of Loudoun County. They are not being constructed on land zoned for industrial or commercial use. Rather, in most cases the developers have chosen to seek special use permits from counties to site them on land zoned and master planned for agricultural and forest use.

The reason why is simple. Rural forest and farmland are abundant and cheap. But this kind of land is zoned that way for a reason -- to preserve the rural atmosphere of the counties for the benefit of their citizens. Industrial facilities should be placed in or near other industrial and commercial zones.

Solar factories require the clear cutting and topsoil removal of most of the acres of the proposed factory. And each acre will be covered with approximately 300 solar panels, weighing a total of over 5 tons. Most of these solar panels are made in China. At the end of their useful life, they must be removed -- another extensive undertaking being that they contain toxic chemicals, such as cancer-causing cadmium. We have seen from recently constructed solar factories, like the massive, 6,000-acre Fawn Lake facility in Spotsylvania County, that it is unclear whether the developers have provided an adequate escrow fund to finance the removal of the panels at the end of their useful life. If not, Spotsylvania County and Virginia are facing a potential superfund cleanup site.

The VCEA also removes the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) from effective oversight of solar facilities. The law contains the so-called “permit by rule,” which exempts from DEQ regulation solar projects less than 100 megawatts in size, approximately 90% of the total. This means that the DEQ is effectively neutered from regulating the stream siltation and soil erosion which have been documented in many of the solar projects constructed to date.

For these and other reasons, this record clearly establishes that the VCEA is bad for consumers, bad for the environment, and based on fundamentally flawed public policy.

                Dear Committee, 
As a Roanoke native and a Salem resident, I urge you as you favorably consider legislation during this term of the General Assembly that seeks to mitigate global warming, especially that reduces our Commonwealth&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change-related disasters in the US last year cost us some $158 billion, another in a string of years of multibillion-dollar extreme weather disasters. Despite the pandemic, our US emissions went up 6% last year. Currently, it is summer in South America where there is a heatwave of extraordinary characteristics, creating historical records for Argentina temperatures and persistence of heat. 

I urge you to please listen to the scientists who are asking all of us to &quot;Look UP&quot; – so, yes, we really do need to take the climate-extinction crisis seriously.

It is sensible now to require certain large public buildings to include solar-ready roofs in new construction or significant renovations, saving energy and taxpayer money when solar is added. A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to net-zero standards recover the added construction cost in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years.  

Please support legislation that develops Virginia&#39;s renewable energy infrastructure, legislation our children deserve that will give them a chance.

Thank you for the good work you do on our behalf,
Michael L. Bentley EdD312 N. Broad St.Salem, VA 24153
