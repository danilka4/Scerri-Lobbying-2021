                I&#39;ve worked for the last 6 years as a citizen advocate in Fairfax County to get solar on school roofs.  Students came to me and asked for help in this advocacy.  We&#39;re finally seeing this come about and it will save the school system money.  The utility continues to raise the price of electricity and FCPSchools will have a $1.5M short fall in FY2023 which could have been avoided with the massive deployment of solar as the price is locked in for the term of the agreement.

Students care about the future and the reduction of CO2 from the generation of electricity.  Making schools designed for net zero in Fairfax County will only add 5% to the construction cost and will be recouped in 10 years according to a study that the school system contracted.  The air quality will be better for these students contributing to their health and the learning environment is improved.  

Building schools to net zero and solar ready makes good economic sense.  Please vote in favor of HB471.

                Thank you for the opportunity to voice my support for HB471. 

This bill makes sense because it prepares our buildings for the future. Schools that produce as much energy as they consume are healthier for students, leading to fewer student absences and higher academic achievement.

They are also good for taxpayers. The costs of making a building net-zero (which starts with energy efficiency) and solar-ready is minimal.
A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to energy-positive standards recover the added construction costs in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years.

                I am writing as a taxpaying Virginian who believes that funds allocated for education should be expended, as much as possible, on educating students rather than paying for inefficient and costly operations such as energy consumption for heating and cooling.  It&#39;s pretty simple: spend less on energy and more on education.  I also believe that it is best to be take actions that leave open opportunties for future major gains. Passing HB 471 achieves both of these objectives.  By implementing some fairly basic design requirements, newly constructed public buildings will be positioned to achieve major cost savings over a period of time much shorter than the expected life span of the building.  The same is true for major modifications of those buildings as defined in this bill.  But to maximize these benefits, the building must be ready.   A number of studies have shown this.  For example, a November 2020  study by Perkins Eastman, an international architecure design &amp; consulting firm makes this exact point.  For example, on page 28:  

&quot;PV (solar array panels) is MOST affordable when installed on a building’s roof. PV which must be mounted separately from the building on parking lot awnings and the like is much more expensive, as the project must pay for an additional structure as well as the additional infrastructure to route power from these remote locations into the building power grid. Therefore, the design and massing of the building, as well as the location of HVAC equipment within the building rather than on the building’s roof, is critical to maximize the roof area available for building PV. Roofs that are held to a consistent elevation and kept free of all HVAC equipment (which is located within the building) give the best mounting surface for any required PV arrays.&quot;

Clearly, if you do not pass this bill, you will be wasting taxpayer money on expenditures that could have been easily avoided.  Therefore, I urge you to recommend reporting this bill.
Thank you,
Robin S. Kent

                Hello.  My name is Natalie Pien from Leesburg, VA representing Loudoun Climate Project to speak in support HB471 Solar Ready Roofs.  Since the 2013 General Assembly authorization for Power Purchase Agreements, more than 45 school districts throughout VA have entered in solar PPAs.   Schools with solar panels are 
•	healthier for students inside with fewer absences due to illness, 
•	better for Virginia’s air quality as greenhouse gas emissions are not emitted
•	taking urgently needed steps to mitigate climate change.
While current law requires new public buildings &amp; those undergoing major renovations to meet high energy performance standards, rooftop solar-readiness is not included.  This bill not only adds rooftop solar-readiness, it specifies design and construction to net-zero energy standards in accordance with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers for K-12 schools. Delegate Subramanyam’s legislation is needed to help ensure:
•	healthy students today and into the future
•	fiscal responsibility for taxpayers today &amp; into the future,  
•	a livable planet.
Please vote “Yes” on HB471.  Thank you.

                Solar power energy is used substantially for public facilities across the United States of America. Cities like Santa Fe, New Mexico have installed enough renewable energy on city facilities to provide 25% of its electricity needs, including 4.6MW of solar energy.  HB471 can ensure that Virginia can have solar-ready roofs becoming part of the planning process for new public buildings and those undergoing major renovation. Solar-ready roofs save money for taxpayers by allowing public buildings to install solar at no upfront cost, and with long-term savings.  In fact, this bill will ensure that public schools be designed and constructed to produce as much energy as they consume and become built to net-zero energy standards. Thus, for these reasons CCAN supports this bill HB471.

                We are a group of students from Oakton High School Environmental Club, and we wanted to express our support for HB 471, which requires that renovated schools and public buildings be made ready for solar energy. 

As high schoolers, the transition to clean energy is especially important to our futures. As our high school has undergone its new renovation, we urge not only our school, but other Virginia schools to do their part to make this world more sustainable. Through this bill we are stepping closer to a more green future as the energy consumed is less than is being generated. Solar panels added will not only provide electricity for the school, it will also provide more electricity than is used, creating a net financial gain for schools. 

A study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools showed that new schools built to net-zero standards recover the added construction cost in just 10 years, while schools renovated to that standard recover the cost in 15 years.
