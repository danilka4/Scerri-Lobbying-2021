                Virginians cannot afford - nor is it viable - to go to all electric.   Electricity uses natural gas.  Keep these nonsensical commie ideas out of VA.

                What I don&#39;t get is...why are Republicans behind it?  I thought that one of the Republican Party principles was to keep the government out of our lives.  Now it looks like Republicans are going to tell me what I can put in my kitchen!  What&#39;s next - no microwaves?  Appliances that are not made in the USA?  Where is this headed?    And Stanford just published a study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology  that shows that gas burning stoves pose a greater risk to the planet and public health than previously thought - and that 3/4 of the methane emissions occurred when the gas stoves were turned off.  Who can explain this to me??

                I recently replaced my gas cooktop with an electric induction cooktop, and I couldn&#39;t be more delighted with it. (I have spent time as a professional cook and cook daily now.)
Industry spin has led consumers to believe that they can&#39;t live without gas. Reality is different, and there is no reason to be burning methane in our homes,  polluting our indoor air, and having an extraordinary amount of this greenhouse gas escaping at every step of its delivery. 

This is a Koch-funded model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council and is a protectionist move for the fossil-fuel industry. They pollute for free and profit mightily with what they claim is affordable energy.  

Electrification of our homes is a win for the consumer. Vote NO on HB1257.
Thank  you.

                Thank you for considering Bill 1257.  I am very much in favor of the proposed bill.  This bill would prohibit municipalities from passing an ordinance or imposing a restrictive building code that would deny consumers from acquiring and or using natural gas within their boundaries. 
I appreciate your consideration.

                On behalf of Environment Virginia, I am urging your opposition to HB 1257. If passed, this bill would hinder communities in our state from taking action to tap into the full potential of renewable energy. This would switch Virginia from making progress on clean energy to trying to fight climate change with one hand tied behind our backs. We urge you to oppose it.

All Virginians need clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and a liveable climate. In a greener, healthier world, we would conserve more, use the energy we have more wisely and efficiently and rely only on sources of energy that are clean, renewable and leave less environmental damage in their wake. 

To make that vision a reality, one key step is to repower our homes with clean, renewable energy. That means taking steps to replace fossil fuel-powered appliances with efficient, electric technologies. Today, electric heat pumps can heat and cool homes more efficiently and cheaply than gas or oil furnaces. Induction cook stoves heat food more efficiently, more safely and cause less indoor air-pollution than stoves that burn methane gas. In fact, installing fully electric systems in homes and commercial buildings now makes financial sense for owners in almost all new construction.

Virginia has an important role to play. According to Environment America Research and Policy Center’s Electric Buildings 2021 report, completely repowering our state’s homes and businesses with electricity by 2050 would result in a reduction of 6.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the equivalent of taking more than 1.4 million cars off the road. That would mean cleaner air to breathe both inside and outside, cleaner water to drink, and safer living spaces for our loved ones. 

The benefits of electrifying buildings coupled with the urgency of climate change make it more critical than ever that we use the tools at our disposal to make sure that the homes, office buildings and other buildings of tomorrow don’t set us up with the same problems that plague yesterday’s buildings: the environmental, health and consumer hazards of directly combusting fossil fuels in our homes and businesses for heating, cooling and cooking.

If passed, this bill would slow down the deployment of clean energy technologies and keep us hooked on fossil fuels -- even if there is strong statewide support for climate action and clean energy. 

We need a range of tools to prepare for the future. HB 1257 would take away some of those tools by revoking our decision-makers’ ability to restrict the use of fossil fuels such as methane gas in our homes and other buildings. 

We urge you to oppose HB 1257 and instead choose a path that gives us a resounding say in how we power our homes, businesses and communities. Virginians should maintain our freedom to choose efficient, electric buildings, and we should continue to lead the country towards a clean, renewable energy future. 

We respectfully urge you to vote no on HB 1257.

                The Virginia League of Conservation Voters opposes this legislation that would preemptively prohibits all state and local government entities from preventing natural gas in new buildings, slowing the transition to clean energy. This creates a burdensome blockade in the path to a net-zero-emissions economy by 2045. 

HB 1257 not only blocks localities but also authorities like the Department of Environmental Quality and The State Corporation Commission.

                AdvanSix is a leading manufacturer of Nylon 6, a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce fibers, filaments, engineered plastics and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as PPE, ventilator tubing, carpets, automotive and electronic components, sports apparel, food packaging and other industrial applications. It is also the world’s largest single-site producer of ammonia sulfate fertilizer with on-site agronomists and technical support.  Several of the products produced by ASIX have been deemed essential by the Department of Homeland Security.

In Virginia, AdvanSix operates two large Virginia operations with more than 1,200 employees in Hopewell and Chesterfield.

AdvanSix supports House Bill 1257 (Kilgore).  Natural gas is a critical to AdvanSix both for energy but also as a raw material.  AdvanSix is in a unique position, which is that a generally known source of energy is a raw material.  Natural Gas is used to generate intermediate products supporting the ultimate production on Nylon 6 with fertilizer as a by product.  It is critical that we maintain our access to affordable, reliable, secure, and sustainable natural gas service in Virginia.

                The price of energy affects the poor and working man much more than it does any rich politician or or entitled class.  The idiocy espoused by the Biden administration and the leftist politicians in America is it is not just laughable, it is anti-American and impacts impacts each one of us in a negative way.

Stop the spread of communism in our country.  Put America First.  Let us together make America Great Again.

                Despite the moniker, so-called natural gas is nothing more than another fossil fuel. Gas contributes heavily to air and water pollution and climate change. This bill will undermine the goals laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act by locking Virginia into a fossil fuel powered future, halting building electrification efforts across all public entities.  Burning excessive fossil fuel harms the environment,as well as Virginia’s residents.  The production of air pollutants created by fossil fuel burning has contributed to increased risk of death from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory illness among those exposed.  And it is for these reasons, CCAN Action Fund opposes this bill HB1257.
