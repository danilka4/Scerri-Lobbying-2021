                The Virginia Clean Economy Act was established to provide an increase in clean energy jobs and reduce Virginia&#39;s carbon emissions by expanding wind and solar power. By allowing this bill to move forward, it will eliminate incentives for utilities to develop pilot programs for the state. Pilot programs play an important role by encouraging new and innovative approaches to energy efficiency programs. Such programs provided by the VCEA help Virginia populations save money and obtain essential access to energy sufficient projects. This bill will make it more difficult for these vulnerable Virginia populations to access energy efficiency programs that will save them money. And it is for these reasons, NRDC opposes this bill HB73.

                The Virginia Clean Economy Act provides major job opportunity and economic growth for the Commonwealth by including capacity requirements for clean energy sources. This bill would remove the capacity requirements within the VCEA, which would significantly slow and in many cases stop the progress of clean energy companies in the state, potentially losing tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment to Virginia. Clean energy businesses, such as Strata Clean Energy, are a major asset to the Commonwealth, bringing new jobs, local tax dollars, opportunities for landowners and providing independent energy sources. In order for clean energy companies to continue to invest and create good-paying jobs in the Commonwealth, we respectfully request the Members of the Committee vote against HB 73.

RE: Virginia Businesses Support the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Regional Greenhouse Gas Program (RGGI), and Clean Cars 

Dear Chair Byron and Members of the House Commerce and Energy Committee: 

Ceres is a nonprofit organization working with major companies and investors to build economic solutions to climate issues. We write today to share the position of the business community in Virginia on the bills before the Committee that propose to modify the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) as well as Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and Advanced Clean Cars (&quot;Clean Cars&quot;) program. Members of Ceres BICEP Network* with operations in Virginia include Adobe, Ball Corporation, IKEA, JLL, Kaiser Permanente, Lyft, Mars Inc., McDonald’s, Microsoft, Nestle, Salesforce, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries. 

As large employers and energy users, businesses understand how Virginia’s energy policy affects the cost of doing business. Maintaining market-friendly climate policies like the VCEA, RGGI and Clean Cars will enable Virginia to make critical progress on pollution and decarbonization while investing in a competitive, resilient economy. The VCEA is an attractive policy for companies looking to power their operations with renewable energy to make investments in Virginia. Energy efficiency and renewable standards keep energy costs low, consistent, and predictable over the long-term, allowing companies to plan ahead. That’s why 97 companies in Virginia have committed to power all of their corporate operations with 100% renewable energy. Continuing to participate in RGGI will ensure that state’s clean energy transition includes critical financial support to vulnerable coastline communities through flood mitigation programs and to vulnerable households statewide through funding for low-income energy efficiency programs. Further, predictable, stable energy policy sends a signal to new businesses that Virginia is a good place to invest. 

On behalf of seven businesses and four higher education institutions, I am pleased to share the attached letter urging the Virginia Legislature to maintain and build upon the considerable progress made in recent years to confront the climate crisis and build a competitive in-state clean energy market. The following companies, Hannon Armstrong, Lutron, Mars, Inc., Nestlé, Unilever, Workday, and Worthen Industries, and higher-ed institutions Sweet Briar College, University of Lynchburg, Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, and Virginia Wesleyan University share their support in the letter for the VCEA, RGGI, and Clean Cars, citing the significant business benefits of these policies, such as lower energy costs, new in-state investments, and programs that will help them meet their own climate goals. The signatories urge legislators to maintain a hospitable environment for clean energy investments going forward. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, and please be in touch with any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Mel Mackin 
Manager, State Policy
