                 I urge you to open access to solar power in SWVA for people, businesses, and organizations unable to install solar on their own building . These bills (SB629/HB1634) are about fairness - restoring equity to solar access for electric customers regardless of where they live in Virginia. The General Assembly passed bipartisan legislation in 2020 (SB629/HB1634) to create a shared solar program in Virginia. This program is important to provide fair customer access to solar regardless of income level, building ownership, condition, or shading, who otherwise are left out of the opportunity to adopt solar power. These bills provide new opportunities to build solar on brownfields and mine lands and create jobs in the areas where the programs are available. Critically the bills will provide local employment opportunity and attract new businesses interested in being solar-powered. Only shared solar subscribers in Dominion Energy service area receive a bill credit for their proportional output of shared solar projects. As it now stands, the law discriminates against electric customers in SWVA. The 2020 legislation had significant bipartisan support throughout the 2020 legislative session, and the bills received unanimous support in committee and on the floor before being amended by conference committee. The bills&#39; original language included Appalachian Power Company (APCo) and Kentucky Utilities/Old Dominion Power (ODP) in the program. On 3/7/20, the conference report narrowed the definition of utility to only include Dominion, eliminating APCo and ODP customers. Shared solar is particularly needed in Southwest Virginia where coal mine land suitable for solar is not large enough to support utility-scale projects, but can support community-scale projects (1-5 MW). HB 832 (Del. Wilt) and SB 659 (Sen. Hanger and Sen. Edwards) will permit APCo and ODP customers to access the same program as Dominion customers. Customers in Southwest Virginia deserve the same fair and equal access to solar programs and the associated jobs and economic benefits as are currently available to customers in other parts of the state. The bill simply changes the definition of utility to include all three investor-owned utilities in Virginia. Thank you for your service to Virginia and for restoring equity and fairness for Southwest Virginians.

                Dear Delegates,
As a resident of Salem, I urge you to support HB832 today so as to allow solar energy sharing in other parts of the state other than those served by Dominion, like where I live. I am a retired professor who has taught courses in meteorology and climate many times in my career and am up on the science. We are in a climate emergency and we must make alternative sources of energy available to citizens in order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is a step in the right direction. Please do the right thing for the western part of our Commonwealth.

                My husband and I have long been interested in providing some of our electrical needs by use of solar energy. After looking into the feasibility of installing rooftop solar panels and finding our heavily wooded surroundings do not provide enough daily sunlight, we sought info about shared solar community projects. We are sold on the idea that by subscribing to and paying through monthly energy bills, we could benefit, along with our neighbors and community, from a shared community solar energy offered by one’s local power company. The problem in Southwest Virginia, however, is that our Appalachian Power Company has not made this option available to us. Because Southwest Virginia utilities are not required to provide the option, we can participate in this win-win program for power companies and their customers. Therefore, we strongly urge you to support legislation HB 832 and SB 659 in favor of legally requiring public utilities companies to offer the shared solar option to all customers, thereby providing the possibility of more jobs, industrial growth, and solar access to everyone, including schools and businesses, low-income residents who live in apartments or multi-family housing, or people like us who have too many trees! Such action will also support one of the Virginia Department of Energy’s stated primary goals for addressing climate change and energy diversification.

                As a scientist, I’ve read about climate change and global warming since the 1980’s. It has taken almost a lifetime for the nations of the world to recognize that these things are actually happening and changing our world in a negative way. Any efforts to slow, stop, and reverse these changes that are taking place that are not themselves negatively impacting the environment should be adopted in order to save our planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come. There is no choice if we are to be stewards of the earth.

Many people nationwide live in housing situations that are not conducive to embracing solar as an alternative energy source—they live in shaded areas, or don’t have land and monies to install solar arrays, or they live in apartments with no ownership of the buildings—but as caring stewards they would willingly do so if given the opportunity.

That is why passage of HB 832 and SB 659 is so important to residents of southwest Virginia. It affords residents in the region the option to utilize solar energy for their needs via their existing electric suppliers. In particular Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power that currently do not provide this option to their customers.

As a long-time southwest Virginia resident, who wants to help preserve our earth for future generations, I implore you to vote in support of this legislation.

                I live in Dickenson County.  Everyone is asking that by some means everyone gets solar energy, even those who cannot afford the solar panels.  This HB 832 will be a good step in that direction.  It will help with pocketbook savings, economic development , and job growth.  With humanity under a Code Red Warning from the UN because of climate change, the verified record heat of 100 degrees within 6 miles of the Artic, and 64.9 degrees in the Antarctic  we are in a race.  We want to be winners.

                Making solar more available is absolutely necessary for us to have fair access to power while reducing our carbon footprint. HB832 is the answer.

                Please support HB 832 (Wilt) that would allow residential customers of Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power to participate in a program known as &quot;shared&quot; solar. 

Shared solar programs allow customers who rent, who don&#39;t have a solar-friendly roof or who can&#39;t afford their own array to purchase solar energy from a 3rd-party owned project that&#39;s typically fairly small (often in the 1-2 MW range). These programs are currently being developed for customers of Dominion Energy but Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power do not allow shared solar in their service areas, and I believe this is a significant inequity for folks in SWVA, including in Montgomery County where I live. Shared solar is a cleaner and cheaper energy resource, and more people should be able to pursue it.  Please help make this opportunity available to us!
